**StdDlgButton** is the class used for each button in the [button area](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/standard-dialog-framework-nodes/standard-dialog-framework-overview.md#structure). The buttons are displayed in the order in which they are listed as children of the [**StdDlgButtonArea** node](https://developer.roku.com/docs/references/scenegraph/standard-dialog-framework-nodes/std-dlg-button-area.md). The size and layout of each button are controlled by the StandardDialog layout algorithm. **StdDlgButton** nodes should only be used as children of a **StdDlgButtonArea** node.
