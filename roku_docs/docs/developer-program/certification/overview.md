# Channel certification overview
All public channels must meet Roku's [certification criteria](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/certification/certification.md#certification-criteria-1) to be published to the Roku Channel Store. This ensures that all channels in the Roku Channel Store have properly integrated required platform features in order to provide viewers a consistent user experience.
## Channel testing
Roku provides a suite of tools and tests to help developers check whether their channel complies with the [certification criteria](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/certification/certification.md):
  * [Static Analysis tool](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/certification/cert-tests/static-analysis-tool.md): Checks the channel's code for certification-related errors.
  * [Channel Behavior Analysis tool](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/certification/cert-tests/channel-behavior-analysis-tool.md): Verifies that the channel meets performance and deep linking requirements. This tool may be used for SVOD, AVOD, and free channels.
  * [Channel pre-certification tests](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/certification/cert-tests/certification-testing.md): Provides a list of tests that channels can run during development to prepare for Roku's channel certification process.

Developers are expected to use the [Static Analysis](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/certification/cert-tests/static-analysis-tool.md) and [Channel Behavior Analysis tool](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/certification/cert-tests/channel-behavior-analysis-tool.md) tools, the [list of pre-certification tests](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/certification/cert-tests/certification-testing.md), and the [certification criteria](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/certification/certification.md#certification-criteria-1) to guide internal quality assurance testing before submitting an channel to Roku for review and publishing.
