# Branded delivery specifications
_Version 2.0_ - _March 2025_
## 1. General overview
Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. The company operates the No. 1 TV streaming platform in the U.S. as measured by hours streamed (Hypothesis Group 2021). The Roku Channel is a top streaming channel on the Roku platform, owned and operated by Roku. It is available to consumers in the U.S., Canada, and the UK for free on Roku streaming devices, the Web, Amazon Fire TV and select Samsung TVs, and iOS and Android devices.
The Roku Channel is committed to providing the highest quality content and values its Partners for helping to achieve this goal. The Roku Post Production Delivery Specifications outline the best practices for the Partner at this time.
This document covers the guidelines and protocol throughout the entirety of the Post Production process of a Roku Brand Studio Custom Series project. If you have any questions or do not think the needs of your project fit these guidelines, please contact [dlropost@roku.com](http://dlropost@roku.com/). These requirements are subject to change at Roku’s sole discretion.
## 2. Post kick-off
Post Producer resumés should be sent to Roku for approval. One week prior to Production start, please reach out to Roku Post Production to set up a kick-off call. In preparation for this call, please review this full specification document so that we can address any follow-up questions you may have.
During the kick-off call, ensure the following topics have been discussed:
  * Final deliverables list, including cutdowns
  * Brand guidelines and assets

### 2.1 Startup documents
Additionally, please make sure to send the preliminary versions of all documents noted below to Roku Post Production prior to the first day of Production. Available templates have been provided in the Post Kick-off zip file.
  1. Post Grid (Please send in excel format, not PDF)
  2. Post Production Contact List
  3. Preliminary Vendor List
  4. Dailies Memo

#### 2.1.1 Episode numbering & post grid workflow
Post Grids accuracy must be confirmed weekly either via revised grid or an email reflecting that no changes have been made. For distribution, Roku requires these grids to be both uploaded to The Hub and emailed to a distribution list that Roku Post Production will provide prior to Production.
Please note that the Post Grid template provides columns for multiple types of series, as noted below. If a specific column does not apply to your show, you can disregard it.
  * **Production Number** : 3-digit number that reflects season number and sequencing of shot material (101, 102, etc.)
  * **Air Order** : 1-digit number that reflects the order in which each episode will air.

### 2.2 Notifications workflow
  * Any changes to the post schedule/ calendar must be communicated and approved by Roku Post Production and Roku Brand Studio.
  * **Client Review, QC Delivery and Final Delivery dates cannot shift without written approval by Roku Post Production and Roku Brand Studio.**
  * At the below milestones please set a call with the Roku Post Production Manager at the email address provided on the contact sheet:
    * 1 week prior to Production
    * 1 week prior to the first scheduled rough cut release date
    * 2 days before review cuts go to client
    * Within one week of production wrap

### 2.3 Misc.
  * Please be sure to include the brand and full name of the show in the subject line of all email correspondence. Do not use acronyms for the title of the show.
  * Do not include the Roku name or logo on any documents (including contact sheets, call sheets, PR’s, casting notices etc.) without written permission from Roku Production.
  * The Roku Contact sheet is for Studio use and should not be distributed widely.

### 2.4 Roku localization
Roku’s Localization Team will handle the creation of Latin Spanish subtitles and Audio Descriptions (AD) files.
## 3. Production
Each production will be required to submit a Dailies Memo prior to the commencement of principal photography. The memo should confirm camera(s) being utilized as well as the workflow for processing all captured video and audio.
### 3.1 Capture specifications
  * Unless otherwise approved by Roku Production prior to the commencement of principal photography, you will be required to capture at a minimum resolution of HD (1920x1080) and an aspect ratio of 16:9 to match final deliverables specs. Any changes to the required resolution or aspect ratio must be approved by Roku.
  * All material should be captured, transferred, and mastered in a progressive frame rate, 23.976 being preferred. Please do not apply any cross-conversions to content.
  * Please reach out to Roku Post to confirm capture frame rate.
  * Please do not apply in-camera upscaling or de-squeezing to any camera masters. If your desire is to work with cameras that do not natively capture in 4K, please reach out to Roku Post Production to discuss workflow options.

### 3.2 Dailies selects
Confirm with Roku Brand Studio if there are brand or product-specific dailies that need to be reviewed after production wrap.
When Dailies Selects are requested, please follow the guidelines below:
  * Selects must be uploaded during the first week of production unless b-roll capture is scheduled. If the latter is the case, reach out to your Roku Post Manager to strategize the timing for posting Selects.
  * Please choose select takes that confirm production is proceeding as intended. It is not necessary to post all media from each day.
  * Dailies should be posted to [Frame.io](http://frame.io/). Roku Post Production will provide a distribution list prior to the first day of dailies.

## 4. Security
Security is of the utmost importance to Roku. As such, access to all of the exciting content we are creating together must be limited. Please review Roku’s security requirements noted below and reach out to Roku Post Production with any questions.
### 4.1 Review platform
Roku’s approved platform for content sharing and final archive is [Frame.io.](https://frame.io/) Roku and [Frame.io](https://frame.io/) have developed a content review workflow that both ensures security and limits access to all pre-launched content. In this workflow, anyone viewing Roku content will be required to set up a user account with [Frame.io](https://frame.io/) so that their activity can be tracked.
**_No material should be shared on any other platform without written approval from Roku._**
### 4.2 Download access
**It is not permitted for anyone to have direct, clean download access to any Roku content without written approval from Roku.**
For team members who require reference Quicktimes in order to complete their work efficiently (i.e., Composers, Music Editors, Graphic Designers, VFX Supervisors) , please follow the steps below:
  * Submit a written request with the recipient’s name, email, and use case:
    * Each file must be watermarked with the recipient’s full name and located in the center of the picture.
    * Recipients should never be given access to an entire folder’s worth of content; Review links that contain solely the required assets should be sent to the Roku approved recipients. This link must be manually expired as soon as the file has been successfully downloaded.
    * Files should always be housed on a vendor’s secure SAN. Files are never permitted to be stored on anyone’s personal device.
    * It is the responsibility of each show's Post team to request vendor deletion of these files at show wrap.

### 4.3 Content review
[Frame.io's](http://frame.io/) Roku Partner Playbook is shared with the Post team at the start of each project. This workflow must be followed for both cuts released to Roku and cuts released prior (Editor, Director, Producers, etc). If you have not received this document, please reach out to Roku Post Production.
All guidelines below must be followed when sharing review links:
  * It is never permitted to share rough cuts externally via Public Links. Review Links require user login and are the only approved method for content review.
  * It is not permitted for any rough cut viewing links to be download-enabled.
  * All viewing links must include an expiration date that confines access to seven days or less.
  * **All cuts uploaded for review must be watermarked.**
  * If making a link for client review, use a password-protected presentation link with download disabled.

### 4.4 Non-Standard requests
It is not permitted to send content to anyone who is not a [Frame.io](http://frame.io/) user without written approval from Roku.
## 5. Rough cuts
### 5.1 Post weekly sync
Before Post Production, your Roku Post Manager will reach out to schedule a weekly call. The call will be an informal sync to determine how the rough cuts are progressing and help address any questions you may have. If you have made any changes to the Post Grid over the week prior, please send a revised version prior to this call.
### 5.2 Rough cut formatting
#### 5.2.1 General requirements
Below are the basic parameters to keep in mind as you begin the rough cut process:
  * Total Run Times:
    * Ad Length – 00:15 or 00:30 TRT
    * Marquee Ad Video (MAV) - Between 00:06 and 00:15
    * Short form - Each episode should be no longer than 15 minutes in total run time. Each episode’s content and length should be approved by the Roku Content team prior to lock.
    * Half hour - Each episode’s run time should be between 22-24 minutes.
    * Hour long - Each episode’s run time should be between 44-48 minutes.

  * Each episode’s content should be approved by the Roku Brand Studio team prior to lock.
  * Episodes should be cut, mastered, and delivered as separate episodes; not a long-play master.
  * The use of blurs on un-cleared video content is not permitted without Roku Creative approval beforehand.

#### 5.2.2 Music
Roku distributes content worldwide. Music should be cleared in perpetuity (or for licensed projects, the full length of the license), and allow for in-context promotional use, unless approved in writing by Roku Production Legal. Please source music that is covered by the following PROs: BMI, ASCAP, SESAC, and GMR.
For branded content, Roku uses DeWolfe Music as a music provider. Please contact your Roku Post Production Manager to be granted a login and password to access DeWolfe’s library.
#### 5.2.3 Rating guidelines
Roku Originals content must fall within a TV-14 or TV-PG rating. Some general ratings guidance has been provided below for you to keep in mind as the creative story progresses in editorial. Please note, however, this is a very subjective process and the rating tiers below are regularly reviewed and may be modified in response to shifts in industry standards. So please be sure to reach out to your Roku Legal contact if you have any questions or clarifications.
**Rating Tiers**
| VIOLENCE | SEX/NUDITY | SUBSTANCE USE/ABUSE | LANGUAGE

#### 5.2.4 Graphics milestones and review process
Roku should be involved in key discussions related to graphics from title treatments to episodic graphics packages. All graphics work (title treatment, lower thirds, interstitials, etc.) must be completed by a Roku approved graphics vendor. These vendors are listed in the Roku Approved Graphics Vendor List in the Branded Content Series Kick-off Packet. This is to ensure brand safety and so graphics can have a streamlined approval before review of RC1 is underway. Roku Brand Studio requires final versions of graphics to be included for approval starting at the RC1 stage. This most importantly includes the title treatment. An RBS project will always have a graphics review timeline with the below milestones:
  1. A minimum of three graphics vendor options must be sent to Roku for review and approval
  2. Style frames that include 3-4 different creative directions (initial designs, mood board, color palette, fonts)
    1. Each creative direction should include static drafts of title treatment, lower thirds, segment name cards, informational graphics template, etc...
  3. RBS selection of approach to graphics from style frames along with some further notes
  4. 1st round of animated drafts to RBS
  5. RBS Notes of first round
  6. 2nd round of animated draft(s) to RBS
  7. RBS approval of graphics
  8. Delivery of title treatment to Roku Post and implementation of graphics into RC1

Once it is approved, the title treatment should be delivered to the Roku Brand Studio in PNG or MOV with transparency layers along with a consolidated After Effects Project, PSD, or Adobe Illustrator project file.
After Roku has approved all in-show graphics and the first cut is locked, no changes should be made without written approval from RBS.
### 5.3 Rough cut review
#### 5.3.1 Review platform
Roku’s approved platform for dailies, rough cut release, and final archive [Frame.io](https://frame.io/). All content being sent for review by the Roku team will need to be shared via this platform. If you are working with a partner who utilizes a different internal platform, there will not be a need to render out separate files just for use with [Frame.io](https://frame.io/); Frame.io’s platform is compatible with most commonly used codecs, which allows the same file to be uploaded to both platforms.
The Roku Post team will initiate onboarding prior to the first day of production. That will trigger a member of the [Frame.io](http://frame.io/) team to reach out to set up a training session with your team. Each series will only be granted one ‘Team Manager’, who will have the ability to add users and download content (with Roku’s approval).
#### **5.3.2 Cut review & turnaround timing**
For each episode, Roku will provide notes listed within the Post Grid, but this is usually within 48 business hours after receipt, whether the Production Company is based in the United States or outside the United States. For cuts submitted earlier than the scheduled date, please note that the original notes return timing will need to be honored unless otherwise approved by Roku.
Release Workflow:
  * All episode rough cuts should be sent for review at the same time.
    * Split release schedules must be approved by RBS before production begins.
  * Timing:
    * If a cut is sent to Roku after 6:00 PM PST, then it will be deemed received the following business day.
    * If a cut is scheduled to go to client for review, then all deadlines for materials should be sent to Roku by 4:00 PM PST.
      * Note that this is for Roku’s own internal review before client. Roku will still have to approve the cut before sending to client. Additional edit requests may be sent back to the Production Company before the end of that day.
  * Review Links:
    * For review cuts to Roku, send [Frame.io](https://frame.io/) links to the review folder with NO passwords. Viewers will be required to sign into Frame.io.
    * For review cuts to client, send public presentation links with a simple, show-specific password. Viewers will not be required to sign into [Frame.io](https://frame.io/).
  * All Fine & Locked Cuts must be delivered per Roku’s exact formatting specifications or they will be rejected.
  * Locked cuts are approved once RBS has received written approval from client.

**Rounds of Review:**
Please consult with RBS to determine the amount of Roku internal reviews and client reviews needed for a project. A typical RBS project will have a cut review similar to below:
  * Roku Rough Cut 1 → Client Rough Cut 2 → Roku Fine Cut 1 → Client Fine Cut 2 → Roku Locked Cut Review → Client Locked Cut Approval

Up to three short-form episodes, two half-hour episodes, or one hour-long episode can be sent within a 48-hour period. For any variations to the schedule above, please check with your Post Production or Content executive for review and approval prior to the release of the first rough cut.
For any variations to the schedule above, please check with your Post Production and RBS Contact for review and approval prior to the release of the first rough cut.

### 5.5 Rough & locked cut delivery
Roku Post Production will provide a recipient list for all rough cuts prior to the scheduled release of the first episode. The [Frame.io](https://frame.io/) team will walk each project through Roku’s preferred rough cut release workflow, which involves two notifications:
  1. An email from the show team to the entire distribution list, noting the availability of cuts and when notes should be sent back to the show team, as well as any editorial caveats if applicable.
  2. A notification from [Frame.io ](https://frame.io/)directly, which happens automatically as each cut is copied into the Shared Folders on [Frame.io](https://frame.io/).

For each locked cut, you will be required to deliver the following elements via [Frame.io](https://frame.io/):
  * Locked Cut QuickTime
  * Locked Cut EDL
  * Locked Cut WAV Files: Mono Dialogue, Mono Music, Mono Effects

Cut file names must follow the proper naming convention below:
  * Show Code (4-digits; Provided by Roku Post)
  * Brand = Associated Brand
  * Production number (3-digits: 101, 102, 103, etc.)
  * Air Sequence (If available; 1-digit: 1, 2, 3, etc.)
  * Cut version (Rough Cut 1, FC, etc.)
  * Date the cut was released to Roku (YYYYMMDD)

Example: FLIP_Nike_102_AIR_2_FC_20191115
For an initial internal review round, the cut should be labeled “Rough Cut 1,” and the proceeding cut to client as “Rough Cut 2” in the “CutVersion#” field.
All rough cut links should be confined to viewing only (i.e. no download access). When sharing cuts, please do not create any folders, or copy any folders into the Roku Review projects.
### 5.6 Color correction and sound mix review
All locked cuts should have client approval before moving into Color Correction and Sound Mix. RBS will require review and approval of both preliminary stills and proposed final color.
NOTE: RBS will need to review color and mix before moving into final finishing.
Timing and review links procedures for reviews of Color Correction and Sound Mix should be identical to rough cut reviews mentioned in Section 5.3.3. Specifications should be identical to rough cut reviews mentioned in Section. 5.4. All color corrected and sound mixed files should be submitted as a single video file for review.
Please confirm with RBS to determine the amount of Roku internal finishing reviews and (if any) client reviews needed for a project. If branded product is included in the series, be sure to prioritize those color corrected images if first submitting stills.
For any variations to the schedule above, please check with your Post Production and RBS Contact for review and approval prior to commencement of Sound Mix and Color Correction.
## 6. Credits
Please discuss with Roku Brand Studio if there should be any opening or closing credits.
During the initial design phase of any title treatments, please reach out to your Roku Brand Studio contacts. You should discuss the following:
  * The branding and language required to accompany the title treatment of the show.

#### 6.1.1 Disclaimer use
If your show contains sensitive content, please reach out to your Roku Legal Executive to see if your episode requires a trigger warning prior to the cold open.
**For any other opening cards or disclaimers, please reach out to Roku Post Production for approval.**
#### 6.1.2 Main title card
For shows that choose to utilize a main title card, please follow the formatting requirements below:
  * Duration of this card will be a maximum of 5 seconds.
  * The title card will display the show title/logo, burned into picture as part of each final video master.
  * Title must be within the 16x9 title safe zone.
  * No possessory, or origination credits permitted anywhere on the program.
  * Any request to include on-screen credits on this card will require approval by the Roku Content and Post Production teams.
    * No other credits are permitted in the opening of the show.

### 6.2 End credit sequence
Please discuss with RBS if any credits, logos, disclaimers or branded cards need to go at the end of the program.
  * The end of the last logo card will signify your last frame of picture.
  * No credits may appear after the end logo cards.

## 7. Final delivery
The specifications below detail all deliverables required for each Roku production. A production will not be considered wrapped until all assets below are delivered and approved by the Roku Post Production team. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to Roku Post Production.
The Delivery Phase begins as soon as your episodes are ready for Quality Control, after VFX, color, and mix are complete. Once the Production Company’s QC has been complete, please send to Roku for a brand safety and creative QC as well.
The assets listed below are considered “Launch Critical.” This means they are required for ingest and launch on the Roku platform.
  * Still Photographs (Listed in 7.4)
  * Key Art (Listed in 7.5)
  * Video Deliverables (Listed in 7.6)
  * Marquee Ad Videos (MAV) Deliverables (Listed in 7.6.5)
  * Audio Deliverables (Listed in 7.7)
  * Time Text Delivery (Listed in 7.8)
  * Paper Deliverables (Listed in 7.10)

### 7.1 Onboarding
Roku uses an External Deliverables Hub (“Hub”) to receive specific production documents. This Hub will also provide information necessary for the naming of each document and file deliverable. If you have not heard from the Roku Post Production team prior to delivery, please reach out to be set up with access to the Hub.
### 7.2 Quality control (QC)
If there is an extremely tight turnaround on the delivery of a master, in lieu of a standard QC vendor, the production partner will be required to complete a full review of each master prior to delivery via Aspera. Once complete, the partner will be required to send an email confirmation to RBS to confirm video, audio, technical and brand specifications have been met, as well as confirming the final file name.
Partners undergoing QC are responsible for covering the cost of and delivering 100% QC approved content. Partners will be required to send all masters noted below to **one of Roku’s approved QC vendors:**
  * Texted Master
  * Textless Master

All required versions for each episode should be delivered to the QC facility on the same day. This will ensure the QC operator can verify there is no variation between the texted / textless timings.
Please be sure to build time into your delivery schedule to account for the Roku QC of each episodes’ masters. Delivery will not be considered ‘Final’ unless all masters have been given a QC by either a vendor or a production partner. A list of suggested vendors will be provided in the Post Kick-off Packet.
If an episode has passed QC but a revision is necessary (incorrect titles, production card modification, etc.) you **must** reach out to Roku Post before any redelivery is made. Please send an email with a detailed and time coded breakdown of what fixes are being requested so that Roku can review and determine the impact it will have on each team and the show premiere itself.
**7.2.1 Texted spotting list (TSL)**
For series undergoing QC, you will be required to deliver a TSL file for each episode when it is submitted for QC. This list will help QC vendors verify that creatively intended text is included in the final file. Roku Post will provide a TSL template to each series.
The TSL should contain any and all text that is burned into picture, and the corresponding timecodes for each. If an episode has no burnt-in text, you will still be required to deliver this file, but will specify the lack of text by checking the box at the top of the template.
**7.2.2** **Harding testing**
Please alert Roku Post Production if any episodic content contains flashing/strobing lights or other image patterns that have the potential to trigger seizures in viewers with Photosensitive Epilepsy. In these instances, you will be required to run a Harding Test and provide the passing report to Roku Post Production as part of Final Delivery.
Please refer to the [Ofcom ITC Guidelines](https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0021/16248/gn_flash.pdf) for further information.
### 7.3 Aspera delivery
Roku accepts delivery content to The Roku Channel via Aspera which can be configured as either an Aspera Shares (using the Aspera Connect Browser plugin) or as an Aspera P2P/Enterprise connection (using Aspera Client or Console). To configure for Aspera Shares delivery:
  * Provide the name(s) and email address(es) for users that will be transmitting content to Roku for The Roku Channel.
  * Roku’s Aspera Shares URL: [https://aspera.sr.roku.com](https://aspera.sr.roku.com/)
  * For the review of the RBS team, screeners of the master files and key art should be put on Frame.io as well.
  * Launch Critical Deliveries must be delivered to the **/prod** folder on Aspera**. Do not separate deliverables into separate subfolders. All assets should be under a single folder.**
  * Test files may be delivered to the **/testing** folder.
  * Video, closed captions, and key art files must be delivered in one folder. Video, closed captions, and key art files must also be completely delivered prior to the delivery of the metadata sheet. More regarding the Metadata Sheet in Section 7.10.1.

#### 7.4 Still photographs
A timeline for stills capture, review and delivery should be included in every production calendar, with final delivery of photos happening before the delivery of a project’s first rough cut. Please discuss with the RBS Team how stills should be captured, how many final photos will need to be delivered, and a timeline for creative, selects review, final selection, and delivery.
An example of a stills calendar should look like this:
  * Production Wrap
  * 2 business days later – first round of .jpg selects sent to RBS
  * 2 business days later – Select feedback from RBS due
  * 2 business days later – Final delivery of RAW stills

Capture Requirements:
  * Stills should be captured at the maximum resolution of a camera and in the camera manufacturer's RAW format.
  * Photos should be a mixture of vertically and horizontally oriented, posed talent photography is suggested.
  * Photos should not be candid or BTS in style.
  * In addition to talent stills, photos of sets and locations clear of talent are also required.

Selects Requirements:
  * First-round selects delivered should equate to 20% of the total number of stills taken.
    * First-round selects of stills should be delivered to RBS within 2 business days of production wrap.
    * For ease of review, send same-as-source resolution .jpg versions of stills.
  * In addition to talent stills, photos of sets and locations clear of talent are also required.

Final Delivery Requirements:
  * Stills should be delivered at the maximum resolution of a camera and in the camera manufacturer's RAW format.
  * The minimum number of total stills required is 15.
    * The minimum number of stills per on-screen talent is five.
    * The minimum number of stills per sets/locations is five.
  * Once final, approved still photos have been selected, they should be uploaded to a designated Frame.io folder as part of Final Delivery.

### 7.5 Key art
For a Custom Series, please discuss with Roku Brand Studio if it is the Production Company’s responsibility to create key art:
  * 16x9 Series Key Art (Suggested resolution 1920x1080)
  * 16x9 Episode Background Image (Suggested resolution 1920x1080)
    * Should not have any text.
    * Can have episode-specific talent in frame.
  * Vertical Box Cover Key Art (Suggested resolution 532x800)
  * Series Background Image (Suggested resolution 1920x1080)
    * Should not have any text.
    * Most likely will be a talent-free “plate shot” taken of the set.
  * Series Title Treatment
    * Please provide PSD with transparent layer, Adobe Illustrator, or consolidated After Effects Project.
    * If the treatment has moving / animated elements, also provide a ProRes4444 file with an alpha layer.

### 7.6 Video deliverables
All videos should be delivered at specification unless agreed to with the Roku production team ahead of production.
If your image capture settings are not at the same data rate or higher as the export settings, please reach out to Roku Post or let your Post Manager know. In order to prevent up-sampling, your final export should match the data rate that was captured (for example, if the camera captured ProRes 422, then final export should be ProRes 422 or equivalent instead of 4444 XQ).
If your capture workflow is different than specified above, please contact Roku Post Production before final mastering begins. It is important to keep master sequences and final deliverables in alignment with dailies capture specifications (i.e. free of any up-scaling, cross-conversions, or up-conversions).
#### 7.6.1 Video formatting
All delivery files should be formatted to start at 00:00:00:00.
All video files **MUST NOT** contain any of the following: bars and tone, bumpers, segment recaps or previews, VITC time code, slates, rating cards, FBI warning cards, placards, or watermarks.
Master files should be expected to be the files that will stream on The Roku Channel as is.
#### 7.6.2 Audio formatting
For the Final Texted Masters, all audio should be contained within the delivered mezzanine file. See the audio settings listed in 7.6.3 for specifications based on delivery codec.
**The audio channel mapping and tagging of metadata must be verified via a program like QuickTime 7, QuickTime Pro, Telestream Switch or Adobe Media Encoder for all texted and textless masters.**
  * If the audio is not labeled with the correct metadata (for instance if all channels are labeled as “C” or “Mono”) this will prevent ingest on Roku’s end and will need to be corrected and re-delivered.
  * Incorrectly labeled audio can be manually adjusted in QuickTime Pro without a re-export.

Mixing Specifications:
  * Target -24LKFS +/- 2 (any average between -22 & -26). Based on ITU-R 1170-3 measurement.
  * Audio should not peak above -2 dBfs (True Peak)

#### 7.6.4 Textless delivery
If your content includes burned-in on screen text, you will be required to deliver a Full Episode. This file should include clean, text-free versions of any shots that contain burned-in subtitles or graphic text elements. If the show contains a comprehensive graphics package, please strip all graphics and supply the graphics package or elements in Archival. Video and Audio specs should mirror the Texted Masters noted above.
Audio mapping label verification as noted in 7.6.2 must be verified in textless master.
Additionally, all episodes should be delivered with the same formatting; if one episode requires a textless master then all remaining episodes should also be delivered as textless masters.
Examples of what to remove for the Textless Masters:
Forced Narratives | Credits | Text-Based Graphics

Roku Best Practices
  * Background elements with text, such as street signs, do not need to be included in a Textless version.
  * ‘Forced Narratives’ refers to on-screen text that is used in one of two ways: to translate foreign dialogue into English or to clarify dialogue that may be inaudible.

  * Optional tracks (foreign language, grunts, breathing, etc.) are preferred, if applicable.
  * If budget permits, please create Fully Filled FX stems as part of delivery.

#### **7.7.2 Stitched branded content Aspera delivery (VDMS)**
If a piece of branded content is being stitched into Roku Originals content, Visual Data Media Services (VDMS) is Roku’s branded content delivery partner. Once final deliverables have been approved, the production company must reach out to RokuOriginals@visualdatamedia.com to organize a delivery of all launch critical and archival materials to be put on Roku’s Aspera Share for final content ingest.
Communicating dates with VDMS and your Roku Post Production Partner as far ahead of time as possible is also key, so all parties can be aware of when assets are delivered.
### 7.8 Timed text file delivery
Roku requires all content to be delivered with all the following timed-text formats:
  * Subtitles: Language solely (no inclusion of sound descriptors)
  * SDH: Language in addition to sound descriptors (no forced narratives)
    * These caption files should assume the viewer cannot hear dialogue or important, non-verbal narrative actions such as audio cues, music, sound effects and speaker identification.
  * FN: Forced Narratives solely.

All files are required in an effort to support customers that are deaf or hard of hearing.
Roku requires closed captions and subtitles in **2** formats: SRT, and WebVTT. The files must have the same timecode and frame rate as the video and audio delivered. Character encoding MUST be UTF-8.
**Languages & formats required:**
English (American, Code: enUS): Subtitles, SDH, & FN
**All files should be labeled as follows:**
ShowCode-Brand-ProdNumber-LanguageCode_Format_RevisionDate.srt
**Filename Examples:**
NION-Nike-101-enUS_SDH_20190701.srt
NION-Nike-101-enUS_FN_20190701.srt

#### 7.10.1 Roku metadata template
Metadata allows Roku to ingest and display all series related information for our customers. Please do not alter the formatting of this spreadsheet as it will break the coding required for ingest.
Please find the most recent Roku metadata templates and guidelines [HERE](https://go.roku.com/rokuchannel-ingest-vod#roku-excel-metadata-guidelines-and-templates).
The required details will include, but are not limited to, the following:
  * Show - Title, Description, Primary Spoken Language, Production Companies
  * Season - Title, Description (leave blank if not applicable)
  * Episode - Title, Production Number, Air Order, Total Run Time (TRT)

Please note that Air Order and Episode Titles must be a decision made with and approved by RBS. The Episode Titles must be creative (no “Episode 1”) and should be written with the show writers or receive writer approval.
The metadata sheet should only be submitted after all other Launch Critical materials have been approved.
The metadata sheet must be delivered to the same folder as all other launch critical delivery material. Failure to do so will result in content processing delays. Reach out to the RBS Producer or Post Manager for any needed information for the Metadata Sheet.
#### 7.10.2 Credits documents
Please deliver all of the following items as part of Final Delivery:

#### 7.10.4 Final font memo
Please deliver one document that details the font name and size utilized for identifiers and/or other on-screen text added to each episode (where applicable) to the Hub. If applicable, please also note which vendor created the show logo.
#### 7.10.5 Final vendor list
Please deliver your final version of the Roku Vendor List that you received in the Kick-Off Delivery Packet to the Hub.
#### 7.10.6 Final text spotting list
If an approved QC vendor was used, please deliver the Text Spotting List used to QC the final episodes to the Hub. Please ensure that any changes made during QC are reflected in the final document that is delivered to Roku via The Hub.

If a QC vendor was not used, still submit a final TSL to document all text information for a project.
#### 7.10.7 Episodic delivery checklist
Please deliver the final version of the Roku Episodic Delivery Checklist that you received in the Kick-Off Delivery Packet to the Hub. Please fill in all applicable delivery dates of assets and indicate when Archival will be completed.

## 8. Archival
### 8.1 High resolution masters & source material
Reach out to Roku Post if you do not see a pre-existing folder structure on [Frame.io](http://frame.io/) for Final Archive.
