If your image capture settings are not at the same data rate or higher of the export settings mentioned in 8.4.3, please reach out to Roku Post or let your Post Manager know. In order to prevent up-sampling, your final export should match the data rate that was captured (for example, if the camera captured ProRes 422, then final export should be ProRes 422 or equivalent).
#### 4.3.1 VOD video formatting
All files should be formatted to start at 00:00:00:00.
Files should begin with program and end on the last frame of the Roku Originals logo end card.
All video files **MUST NOT** contain any of the following: bars and tone, bumpers, segment recaps or previews, VITC time code, advertisements, slates, rating cards, FBI warning cards, placards, overlay branding, promotional bugs, informational bugs, watermarks, or website link callouts.
If promotional bugs or watermarks are required by a 3rd party, Roku Content Legal should be notified.
#### 4.3.2 VOD ad breaks
Each project will be required to deliver the VOD video master follows:
  * All ads should be removed from the program.
  * Ad breaks should be formatted as one second of black (no text permitted). Fade outs/ins are permitted.

The exact timecode of each ad break, in HH:MM:SS:FF format, will be required in both the Segment Rundown and Metadata deliverables. Both templates were provided in the Post Kickoff Deliverables Packet. Please reach out to Roku Post if you did not receive one.
#### 4.3.3 VOD audio formatting
For the Final Texted Masters, all audio should be contained within the delivered mezzanine file. See the audio settings listed in 2.3.4 for specifications based on delivery codec.
**The audio channel mapping and tagging of metadata must be verified via a program like QuickTime 7, QuickTime Pro, Telestream Switch or Adobe Media Encoder for all texted and textless masters.**
  * If the audio is not labeled with the correct metadata (for instance if all channels are labeled as “C” or “Mono”) this will prevent ingest on Roku’s end and will need to be corrected and re-delivered.
  * Incorrectly labeled audio can be manually adjusted in QuickTime Pro without a re-export.
Mixing Specifications:
  * Target - 24 LKFS +/- 2 (any average between -22 & -26). Based on ITU-R 1170-3 measurement.
