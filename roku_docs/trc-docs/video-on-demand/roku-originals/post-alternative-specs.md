# Alternative media delivery specifications
_Version 3.0 - August 2025_
## 1. General overview
Roku pioneered streaming to the TV. The company operates the No. 1 TV streaming platform in the U.S. as measured by hours streamed (Hypothesis Group 2021). The Roku Channel is a top streaming channel on the Roku platform, owned and operated by Roku. It is available to consumers in the U.S., Canada, and the UK for free on Roku streaming devices, the Web, Amazon Fire TV and select Samsung TVs, and iOS and Android devices.
The Roku Channel is committed to providing the highest quality content and values its Partners for helping to achieve this goal. The Roku Post Production Delivery Specifications outline the best practices for the Partner at this time. This document and the requirements are subject to change at Roku’s sole discretion.
## 2. Post kick-off
Post Producer resumes should be sent to Roku for prior approval. One week prior to Production start, please reach out to Roku Post Production to set up a kick-off call. In prep for this call, please review this full specification document so that we can address any follow up questions you may have.
### 2.1 Startup documents
Additionally, please make sure to send the preliminary versions of all documents noted below to Roku Post Production prior to the first day of Production. Available templates have been provided in the Post Kickoff zip file.
  1. Post Grid (Please send in excel format, not PDF)
  2. Post Production Contact List
  3. Preliminary Vendor List
  4. Dailies Memo

#### 2.1.1 Episode numbering & post grid workflow
Post Grids accuracy must be confirmed weekly, either via revised grid or an email reflecting that no changes have been made. For distribution, Roku requires these grids to be both uploaded to The Hub and emailed to a distribution list that Roku Post Production will provide prior to Production.
Please note that the Post Grid template provides columns for multiple types of series, as noted below. If a specific column does not apply to your show, you can disregard it.
  * **Production Number** : 3-digit number that reflects season number and sequencing of shot material (101, 102, etc.)
    * One-off Specials should contain the prefix “SP” and begin with 100. (SP100, SP200, etc.).
  * **Air Order** : 1-digit number that reflects the order in which each episode will air.

### 2.2 Notifications workflow
  * Once in production, any changes to the post schedule/calendar must be communicated to Roku Post Production immediately (within 24 hours)
  * **Quality Control Delivery and Final Delivery dates cannot shift without written approval by Roku Post Production**
  * At the below milestones please set a call with the Roku Post Production Manager at the email address provided on the contact sheet:
    * 1 week prior to Production
    * 1 week prior to the first scheduled rough cut release date
    * Within one week of production wrap

### 2.3 Misc.
  * Please be sure to include the full name of the show in the subject line of all email correspondence.
  * Do not include the Roku name or logo on any documents (including contact sheets, call sheets, PR’s, casting notices etc.) without written permission from Roku Production.
  * The Roku Contact sheet is for Studio use and should not be distributed widely

### 2.4 Roku marketing
Marketing will be requesting an early creative sizzle reel and they will be directly involved in the Main Title treatment creative process. Marketing will require both a texted and textless version of the sizzle.
### 2.5 Roku localization
Roku’s Localization Team will handle the creation of Latin Spanish subtitles and Audio Description files (AD).
## 3. Production
Each production will be required to submit a Dailies Memo prior to the commencement of principal photography. The memo should confirm camera(s) being utilized as well as the workflow for processing all captured video and audio.
### 3.1 Capture specifications
  * Unless otherwise approved by Roku production prior to the commencement of principal photography, you will be required to capture at a minimum resolution of HD (1920x1080) and an aspect ratio of 16:9 to match final deliverables specs. Any changes to the required resolution or aspect ratio must be approved by Roku.
  * All material should be captured, transferred, and mastered in a progressive frame rate. Please do not apply any cross-conversions to content.
  * Please do not apply in-camera upscaling or de-squeezing to any camera masters. If your desire is to work with cameras that do not natively capture in 4k, please reach out to Roku Post Production to discuss workflow options.

### 3.2 Dailies selects
  * Roku only requires 5-10 minutes of dailies selects to be posted for each of the first three days of production.
  * Selects must be uploaded during the first week of production unless b-roll capture is scheduled. If the latter is the case, reach out to your Roku Post Manager to strategize the timing for posting Selects.
  * Please choose select takes that confirm production is proceeding as intended. It is not necessary to post all media from each day.
  * Dailies should be posted to [Frame.io](http://frame.io/). Roku Post Production will provide a distribution list prior to the first day of dailies.

## 4. Security
Security is of the utmost importance to Roku. As such, access to all of the exciting content we are creating together must be limited. Please review Roku’s security requirements noted below and reach out to Roku Post Production with any questions.
### 4.1 Review platform
Roku’s approved platform for content sharing and final archive is [Frame.io](http://frame.io/). Roku and [Frame.io](http://frame.io/) have developed a content review workflow that both ensures security and limits access to all pre-launched content. In this workflow, anyone viewing Roku content will be required to set up a user account within [Frame.io](http://frame.io/) so that their activity can be tracked.
**No material should be shared on any other platform without written approval from Roku.**
### 4.2 Download access
**It is not permitted for anyone to have direct, clean download access to any Roku content without written approval from Roku.**
For team members who require reference quicktimes in order to complete their work efficiently (i.e., Composers, Music Editors, Visual Effects Supervisors), please follow the steps below:
  * Submit a written request with the recipient’s name, email, and use case. Upon Roku approval:
    * Each file must be watermarked with the recipient’s full name and located in the center of picture.
    * Recipients should never be given access to an entire folder’s worth of content; Review links that contain solely the required assets should be sent to the Roku approved recipients. This link must be manually expired as soon as the file has been successfully downloaded.
    * Files should always be housed on a vendor’s secure Storage Area Network (SAN). Files are never permitted to be stored on anyone’s personal device.
    * It is the responsibility of each show's Post team to request vendor deletion of these files at show wrap.

### 4.3 Content review
[Frame.io](http://frame.io/)’s Roku Partner Playbook is shared with the Post team at the start of each project. This workflow must be followed for both cuts released to Roku and also cuts released prior (Editor, Director, Producers, etc.). If you have not received this document, please reach out to Roku Post Production.
All guidelines below must be followed when sharing review links:
  * It is never permitted to share rough cuts via Public Links. Review Links require user login and are the only approved method for content review.
  * It is not permitted for any rough cut viewing links to be download-enabled.
  * All viewing links must include an expiration date that confines access to seven days or less.
  * **All cuts uploaded for review must be watermarked.**

### 4.4 Non-Standard requests
It is not permitted to send content to anyone who is not a [Frame.io](http://frame.io/) user without written approval from Roku.
## 5. Rough cuts
### 5.1 Post weekly sync
Once you begin the rough-cut process, your Roku Post Manager will reach out to schedule a weekly call. The call will be an informal sync to determine how the rough cuts are progressing and help address any questions you may have. If you have made any changes to the Post Grid over the week prior, please send a revised version prior to this call.
### 5.2 Rough cut formatting
#### 5.2.1 General requirements
Below are the basic parameters to keep in mind as you begin the rough cut process:
  * Total Run Times:
    * Short form - Each episode should be no longer than 15 minutes in total run time. Each episode’s content and length should be approved by the Roku Content team prior to lock.
    * Half hour - Each episode’s run time should be between 22-24 minutes.
    * Hour long - Each episode’s run time should be between 44-48 minutes.
    * **For All Locked Cuts** - QT's must include a slug for the end credits so that the exact timing is locked to match the final master.
  * Roku requires rough versions of graphics starting at the RC1 stage, and near final graphics by the FC stage. See Section 5.6 for a full breakdown of Roku’s graphics milestones.
  * Episodes should be cut, mastered, and delivered as separate episodes; not a long-play master.
  * There may be discussions around pre-roll, mid-roll, or post-roll advertising cue points. Regardless, please deliver each episode as a seamless master.
  * The use of blurs on un-cleared video content is not permitted without Roku Creative approval beforehand.

#### 5.2.2 Music
Roku distributes content worldwide. Music should be cleared in perpetuity (or for licensed projects, the full length of the license), and allow for in-context promotional use, unless approved in writing by Roku Production Legal. Please source music that is covered by the following PROs: BMI, ASCAP, SESAC, and GMR.
#### 5.2.3 Ad breaks
All Roku Originals series are required to include ad breaks. Please refer to the parameters below based off your episode run times.
  * Short Form episodes with a total run time of 11-15 minutes will be required to include one total ad break into each episode.
    * Short Form episodes with a total run time of less than 11 minutes will not need to include any act breaks.
  * Episodes with a total run time of 22-24 minutes will be required to build three total ad breaks into each episode.
  * Episodes with a total run time of 44-48 minutes will be required to build five total ad breaks into each episode.
  * Formatting across all run times:
    * **The ad breaks should not appear until at least five minutes of content have elapsed.**
    * Ad breaks should be formatted as one second of black (no text permitted). Fade outs/ins are permitted.
    * The last ad break must appear before the last three minutes of an episode, which will remain ad-free.
    * All ad breaks should be spaced anywhere from six to ten minutes apart, dependent on the creative.

All Fine and Locked cuts sent to Roku must adhere to the specifications above. They will not be deemed acceptable otherwise. Please see Section 5.3.2 below for more detail on earlier cut releases.
If an episode will not meet either run time range, and this has been previously approved by Roku’s Content team, please reach out to Roku Post Production to discuss ad break implications.
The exact timecode of each ad break, in (HH:MM:SS:FF) format, will be required in both the Segment Rundown and Metadata deliverables. Both templates were provided in the Post Kickoff Deliverables Packet. Please reach out to Roku Post if you did not receive one.
#### 5.2.4 Rating guidelines
Roku Originals content must fall within a TV-14 or TV-PG rating. Some general ratings guidance has been provided below for you to keep in mind as the creative story progresses in editorial. Please note, however, this is a very subjective process and the rating tiers below are regularly reviewed and may be modified in response to shifts in industry standards. So please be sure to reach out to your Roku Legal contact if you have any questions or clarifications.
**Rating Tiers**
| VIOLENCE | SEX/NUDITY | SUBSTANCE USE/ABUSE | LANGUAGE
---|---|---|---|---
**TV-PG** |  **✔** Shootings, brawls, fist fights
**✖** No blood |  **✔** Limited to kissing, couples in bed, implied sexual situations
**✖** No nudity at all
**✖** No sexual violence |  **✔** Implied drug use (not glorified or must show consequences) |  **✔** Limited use of bleeping/dropping strong language. Ass, damn, hell, and bitch

### 5.3 Rough cut review
#### 5.3.1 Review platform
Roku’s approved platform for dailies, rough cut release, and final archive is [Frame.io](http://frame.io/). All content being sent for review by the Roku team will need to be shared via this platform. If you are working with a partner who utilizes a different internal platform, there will not be a need to render out separate files just for use with [Frame.io](http://frame.io/); [Frame.io](http://frame.io/)’s platform is compatible with most commonly used codecs, which allows the same file to be uploaded to both platforms.
The Roku Post team will initiate onboarding prior to the first day of production. That will trigger a member of the [Frame.io](http://frame.io/) team to reach out to set up a training session with your team. Each series will only be granted one ‘Team Manager’, who will have the ability to add users and download content (with Roku’s approval).
#### 5.3.2 Cut review & turnaround timing
For each episode, Roku will provide notes within 48 business hours after receipt, whether the Production Company is based in the United States or outside the United States. Cuts received by Roku after 6:00 pm Pacific Standard Time will be deemed received the following business day. When sending cuts earlier than the scheduled release date, please note that the original notes return timing will need to be honored unless otherwise approved by Roku Creative.
Locked cuts are approved if no notes have been sent after 48 hours.
Rounds of Review:
  * 101-103*: Rough Cut 1 → Rough Cut 2 → Fine Cut → Locked Cut
  * 104+: Rough Cut 1 → Fine Cut → Locked Cut

Up to two half-hour episodes (or one hour-long episode) can be sent within a 48-hour period. No more than three 10-minute episodes, per show, should be sent within a 48-hour period.
For series with one or more story arcs, episodes should be sent for review in the order they will ultimately air on the Roku platform. For anthology series, or series consisting of stand-alone/self-contained episodes, rough cuts may be sent out of air order, if necessary.

  1. An email to the entire distribution list, noting the availability of cuts and when notes are due back.
    1. This email should include a Segment Rundown that relates to the timing of each specific cut being sent.
  2. A notification from [Frame.io](http://frame.io/), which happens automatically after a cut is copied to the Shared Folder on [Frame.io](http://frame.io/).
For each locked cut, you will be required to deliver the following elements via [Frame.io](http://frame.io/):

  * Locked Cut QuickTime
  * Locked Cut EDL
  * Locked Cut WAV Files: Mono Dialogue, Mono Music, Mono Effects

Cut filenames must follow the proper naming convention below:
  * Show Code (4-digits; Provided by Roku Post)
  * Production number (3-digits: 101, 102, 103, etc.)
  * Air Sequence (If available; 1-digit: 1, 2, 3, etc.)
  * Cut version (Rough Cut 1, FC, etc.)
  * Date the cut was released to Roku (YYYYMMDD)

Example: FLIP_102_AIR_2_FC_20191115
All rough cut links should be confined to viewing only (i.e. no download access). When sharing cuts, please do not create any folders, or copy any folders into the Roku Review projects.
### 5.6 Graphics milestones & review process
The Roku Content & Post Production teams should be involved in key discussions related to graphics, from title treatments to overall episodic graphics packages.
All graphics work (title treatment, lower thirds, interstitials, etc.) must be completed by a Roku approved graphics company. The use of freelance staff or in-house graphics teams is not permitted. Please reach out to Roku Post to obtain the list of approved vendors.
The following milestones require Roku notification and review:
  * **Six Weeks Prior to 1st Rough Cut:** A minimum of three graphics vendor options must be sent to Roku for review and approval.
  * **Four Weeks Prior to 1st Rough Cut:** Due to Roku: Mood board, color palette, title sketches, font, etc.
  * **Two Weeks Prior to 1st Rough Cut:** Due to Roku: First round of design and/or animation examples
  * **One Week Prior to 1st Rough Cut:** Due to Roku: Second round of design and/or animation examples
  * **1st Rough Cut Release**
    * Temp graphics implemented into the cut that is distributed to Roku
    * All temp graphics must be based on creative input from Roku. Any changes from the agreed upon look of in-show graphics will need to be outlined in an email to the Roku Content team.
  * **1st Fine Cut Release:** Final Graphics must be implemented into the cut that is distributed to Roku

After Roku has approved all in-show graphics and the first cut is locked, no changes should be made without written approval from the Roku Content team.
## 6. Final mastering & marketing
### 6.1 Picture & audio mastering
#### 6.1.1 Uncompressed masters
Roku prefers to receive both the un-graded and graded high-resolution master sequences as part of final delivery. These files should be exported in DPX format or TIFF format, at the highest bitrate possible (16-bit preferred).
If your vendor is unable to export these sequences, please reach out to Roku Post Production.
#### 6.1.2 Harding testing
Please alert Roku Post Production if any episodic content contains flashing/strobing lights or other image patterns that have the potential to trigger seizures in viewers with Photosensitive Epilepsy. In these instances, you will be required to run a Harding Test and provide the passing report to Roku Post Production as part of Final Delivery.

#### 6.1.3 HDR10 & dolby vision
Currently, Roku Alternative projects are only required to complete a SDR (Rec709) grade. Please keep in mind your final deliverables will need to be in legal video range.
Roku encourages that all series be graded utilizing the Dolby Vision workflow. Although a HDR deliverable is not yet a requirement for the Roku platform, grading in Dolby Vision will allow for the highest quality visual experience, as well as protect for future inclusion of HDR deliverables.
For Productions whose budgets and schedules permit HDR10 or Dolby Vision grading, please reach out to Roku Post Production to determine the necessary workflow and related deliverables associated with either.
#### 6.1.4 Sound mixing
Roku Alternative projects are required to mix in 5.1 Surround, and then downmix to create Stereo deliverables as well.

## 8. Final delivery
The specifications below detail all deliverables required for each Roku production. A production will not be considered wrapped until all assets below are delivered and approved by the Roku Post Production team. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to Roku Post Production.
The Delivery Phase begins as soon as your episodes are ready for Quality Control, after visual effects, color, and mix are complete. The following timeline is required to ensure that all pertinent assets are received on time for Post, Marketing, and Operations:
  * Due 1 Week Before First Episode Delivered to Quality Control Vendor
    * Let Roku Post know which vendor you’re proceeding with
    * Metadata Ingest Document due to the Hub [See 8.7.1]
  * Due With Delivery to Quality Control Vendor
    * Texted Masters
    * Textless Masters (if applicable)
    * Text Spotting List

### 8.1 Onboarding
Roku uses an External Deliverables Hub (“Hub”) to receive specific production documents. This Hub will also provide information necessary for the naming of each document and file deliverable. If you have not heard from the Roku Post Production team prior to delivery, please reach out to be set up with access to the Hub.
### 8.2 Quality control (QC)
Each Production is responsible for covering the cost of and delivering 100% QC approved content. All masters noted below will be required to be submitted to QC **using one of Roku’s approved QC vendors:**
  * Texted Master
  * Textless Master

All required versions for each episode should be delivered to the Quality Control facility on the same day. This will ensure the Quality Control operator is able to verify that there is no variation between the texted/textless timings.
Please be sure to build time into your delivery schedule to account for the Roku Quality Control process. Roku advises that you set aside two weeks for each episode to complete the Quality Control of all masters. Delivery will not be considered ‘Final’ unless all masters have received a passing report from one of Roku’s approved vendors. A list of these vendors will be provided in the Post Kickoff Packet.
If an episode has passed Quality Control but a revision is necessary (incorrect titles, production card modification, etc.) you **must** reach out to Roku Post before any redelivery is made. Please send an email with a detailed and time coded breakdown of what fixes are being requested so that Roku can review and determine the impact it will have on each team and the show premiere itself.
#### 8.2.1 Texted spotting list (TSL)
You will be required to deliver a Texted Spotting List file for each episode when it is submitted for Quality Control. This list will help Quality Control vendors verify that creatively intended text is included in the final file. A Roku Texted Spotting List template was provided in your Post Kickoff zip file. This single file should be updated as episodes are sent to Quality Control so that all information for the series is included in the same master spreadsheet.
The Texted Spotting List should contain any and all text that is burned into picture, and the corresponding timecodes for each. If an episode has no burned-in text, you will still be required to deliver this file, but will specify the lack of text by checking the box at the top of the template.

### 8.4 Video deliverables
All video should be delivered at specification unless agreed to with the Roku production team ahead of production.
If your image capture settings are not at the same data rate or higher of the export settings mentioned in 8.4.3, please reach out to Roku Post or let your Post Manager know. In order to prevent up-sampling, your final export should match the data rate that was captured (for example, if the camera captured ProRes 422, then final export should be ProRes 422 or equivalent instead of 4444 XQ).
**_Roku Best Practices_**
It is important to keep master sequences (Video Asset Management/Color Timed Master) and final deliverables in alignment with dailies capture specifications (i.e. free of any up-scaling, cross-conversions, or up-conversions).
#### 8.4.1 Video formatting
All files should be formatted to start at 00:00:00:00.
Files should begin with the cold open and end on the last frame of the Roku Originals logo end card.
All video files **MUST NOT** contain any of the following: bars and tone, bumpers, segment recaps or previews, Vertical Interval time code, advertisements, slates, rating cards, FBI warning cards, placards, overlay branding, promotional bugs, informational bugs, watermarks, or website link callouts.
If promotional bugs or watermarks are required by a 3rd party, Roku Content Legal should be notified.
#### 8.4.2 Audio formatting
For the Final Texted Masters, all audio should be contained within the delivered mezzanine file. See the audio settings listed in 8.4.3 and 8.4.5 for specifications based on delivery codec.
**The audio channel mapping and tagging of metadata must be verified via a program like QuickTime 7, QuickTime Pro, Telestream Switch or Adobe Media Encoder for all Texted and Textless Masters.**
  * If the audio is not labeled with the correct metadata (for instance if all channels are labeled as “C” or “Mono”) this will prevent ingest on Roku’s end and will need to be corrected and re-delivered.
  * Incorrectly labeled audio can be manually adjusted in QuickTime Pro without a re-export.

Mixing Specifications:
  * Target - 24 LKFS +/- 2 (any average between -22 & -26). Based on ITU-R 1170-3 measurement.
  * Audio should not peak above -2 dBfs (True Peak)

Channel Mapping & Metadata Tagging | See 8.4.2 -Verify correct audio channel mapping and metadata tagging.
#### 8.4.4 Textless delivery
If your content includes burned-in on screen text, you will be required to deliver a separate Textless Reel or Full Episode. This reel should include clean, text-free versions of any shots that contain burned-in subtitles or graphic text elements. If the show contains a comprehensive graphics package, please strip all graphics and supply the graphics package or elements in Archival. Video and Audio specs should mirror the Texted Masters noted above.
Audio mapping label verification as noted in 8.4.2 must be verified in textless master.
Additionally, if foreign language subtitles cover 30% or more of a given episode, you will be required to deliver a completely textless master of that episode. All episodes should be delivered with the same formatting; if one episode requires a textless master, versus a reel, then all remaining episodes should also be delivered as textless masters.
Examples of what to remove for the Textless Masters:
Forced Narratives | Credits | Text-Based Graphics
---|---|---

_Roku Best Practices_
  * Background elements with text, such as street signs, do not need to be included in the Textless Reel.
  * ‘Forced Narratives’ refers to on-screen text that is used in one of two ways: to translate foreign dialogue into English or to clarify dialogue that may be inaudible.

#### 8.4.5 Final proxy files (clean & visible timecode)
From each Texted Master created, please export the following proxy files:
