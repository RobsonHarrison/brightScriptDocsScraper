# Ingest specifications
Below is a comprehensive list of formatting requirements for partner media assets and metadata, including file templates and delivery guidelines. Roku's ingest platform is fully automated and full compliance with this specification will ensure timely and error-free processing of content for distribution to Roku Channel. Should any changes need to be made to the workflow established during onboarding, please inform a Roku representative as early as possible to arrange for any new testing or configuration. Roku expects content and metadata to be delivered in a manner that was agreed upon during the onboarding and testing phase. Please ensure delivery knowledge is transferred to new personnel in the event that teams are updated or changed.
### MovieLabs
As an alternative to this specification, Roku Channel supports content delivery via MovieLabs specification.
  * **MMC and MEC** - Roku Channel MovieLabs service was built on MEC v2.9 and MMC v1.10 as defined on MovieLabs’ site: <https://www.movielabs.com/md/>
  * **EMA avails** - Roku Channel supports the latest version of the [EMA specification](https://movielabs.com/md/avails/) via the xlsx deliverable

Roku prefers MovieLabs deliverables from all Premium Subscription (SVOD) Partners. Please see additional Roku Channel-specific MovieLabs delivery details [here](https://developer.roku.com/en-gb/trc-docs/video-on-demand/delivery/ingest-specifications.md#movielabs-content-delivery)
## Roku content policies
### Ad policy
Roku will serve up to 8 minutes of advertisements per viewing hour. Roku’s ad policy is subject to change.
#### Ad-supported content on Roku Channel
Roku Channel is looking for ad-supported content that is appropriate for our users and advertisers – for example, Roku Channel does not want ad-supported content that contains excessive nudity or extreme/graphic violence.Please use your best judgement when sharing content. If an asset is questionable, please find an alternative to share. We reserve the right to remove or reject any content that we deem inappropriate.
#### Ad breaks
Ad break timecodes shall be delivered according to the Roku Ad Policy in the adBreak nodes of the movie/episode/clip metadata to trigger ad breaks during playback on the platform. adBreaks should be accurately provided to the millisecond. Please convert any frame rate value to a millisecond equivalent. Providing adBreaks in the ingest metadata is highly recommended and will speed up the QC process. All adBreak data must be supplied as HH:MM:SS.sss (e.g., 01:23:45.678)
##### Movie ad policy
  * No adBreaks should be listed during the first 10 minutes of playback
  * No pre-roll adBreak should be listed – 00:00:00.000
  * adBreak cue points should be provided at naturally occurring scene breaks and/or fades to black
  * There should be no less than 10 minutes between each adBreak
  * No adBreaks within 10 minutes of end credits

##### Series episode ad policy
Content length longer than 15 minutes:
  * No adBreaks should be listed during the first 5 mins of playback

### External branding and calls to action (CTAs)
Roku Channel does not allow branding or external URL links/calls to action on key art or within the video and closed captioning. Calls to action are creatives and/or content segments that direct users outside of the Roku Channel ecosystem to consume content on external services. Video must be edited to remove links or directions for users to visit external sites. This includes:
  * Brand logos
  * Web urls
  * QR codes
  * Verbally or textually calling viewers to "click", "subscribe", "buy now", "go to", etc

Please contact your Roku representative for more details.
### Music cue sheets
Music cue sheets may be submitted to Roku for content distributed to Roku Channel via the below link:
<https://go.roku.com/music-cue-sheet-submission>
Please do not submit music cue sheets with the video package deliverables via Aspera. Cue sheets delivered with the video package will be subject to deletion.
## User experience on Roku Channel
Roku augments metadata and artwork that appears in Roku Channel on Roku devices, web browsers, mobile applications, and other off-platform players with data supplied from Gracenote’s database where available. The Gracenote data aids in a unified experience of a title across platforms as well as on the greater Roku ecosystem. Roku will attempt to match all content delivered by our Partners to a corresponding record in Gracenote’s database. _At this time all metadata and artwork that appears on Roku Channel is sourced from Gracenote if that content is found in Gracenote’s database._
Gracenote leverages "Artwork Personalization" where they supply alternate imagery to diversify title artwork for different users based on several factors (demographics, popularity, etc.); which has led to an increase in user engagement. Gracenote does accept official key art from Partners, but not all users will see official art unless the algorithm serves it to them. Gracenote supplies ~3 unique images, and create alternative versions of artwork sourced from a variety of places (ex. original broadcaster, production studio, creative agency). Gracenote has stated to Roku that all images are under a fair use license, and they apply the same quality standards to Personalized Images as they do to partner supplied Key Art, e.g., no major spoilers, no dark/blurry/grainy images, no violent/suggestive imagery, avoidance of smoking.
Our systems use a combination of methods to match a title its correct Gracenote record. Partners can aid in the matching to a Gracenote record by providing accurate metadata including:
  * Exact title of a series, movie, TV special, or short form video
  * Release dates that are accurate to the year the title was originally released on any platform
  * Accurate season and episode numbers according to the original release order
  * Accurate TMS (Gracenote) IDs by content type
  * Content classified as an episode with Gracenote must be delivered as an Episode to Roku
  * Content classified as a movie with Gracenote must be delivered as a movie to Roku
  * Content classified as a TV Special with Gracenote can be delivered as a movie to Roku

Partners can aid in the curation of their content on Roku Channel by providing Tags with each movie, episode, or clip. Roku Channel editorial team and recommendations engine will utilize the provided Tags and Genres to help surface content on Roku Channel Platform UI. The more tags that are included, the more ways the content can be curated/surfaced to the end user. Please see [Best practices: content tags and metadata](https://developer.roku.com/trc-docs/video-on-demand/content-tags-and-metadata.md) for more details

<https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/captioning-internet-video-programming>
All content required by the FCC to have closed captioning must be delivered to Roku with closed captions and those captions must be conformed and synced to program. For content that is exempt from the closed caption requirement per FCC rules, a valid exemption code number must be included in the metadata. Allowable exemption code numbers and their definitions:
1 - The content has never aired on television in the United States. 2 - The content has only aired on television in the United States without captions. 3 - The content has not aired on television in the United States with captions since September 30, 2012. 4 - The content does not consist of full-length video programming. 5 - The content does not fall within a category of online programming that requires captions under FCC regulations (49 C.F.R. § 79.4(b)). 6 - The FCC and/or U.S. Congress has granted an exemption from caption requirements for this content.
For content intended for territories outside of the US, Roku will adhere to the requirements in that territory.
Captions may be provided in one of two ways:
  * EIA-608/CEA-708 embedded in-stream in the video file
  * Sidecar caption file
  * Roku prefers a human-readable sidecar subtitle file such as .ttml, .dfxp, .vtt, or .srt
  * See below for a full listing of supported sidecar caption files
  * Sidecar captions must begin at timecode hour 00:00:00:00 as the Roku encoder does not honor the timecode embedded in the video file
  * Do not provide an empty file (a file without text) for sidecar captions

## Delivery guidelines
Roku accepts content via Aspera which can be configured as either an Aspera Shares (using the Aspera Connect Browser plugin) or as an Aspera P2P/Enterprise connection (using Aspera Client or Console).
Alternate file transfer or physical delivery methods may be evaluated on a case-by-case basis and must be approved by Roku. Any physical media/hard drives Roku may accept will not be returned.
### Aspera shares delivery
Provide the name(s) and email address(es) for users that will be transmitting content to Roku for Roku Channel.
Roku’s Aspera Shares URL: <https://aspera.sr.roku.com>
You will need to install the Aspera Connect browser plugin to upload content via Aspera Shares.
Invitations to create an Aspera Shares account will come from Roku’s Aspera Shares server. These automated invitation emails can be flagged as spam or junk emails or can be blocked by an organization’s email filtering system or firewall. Please check the spam/junk folder for the invitation and move it from the spam/junk folder before trying to access the link provided.
### Aspera enterprise/P2P/HSTS delivery
Roku authenticates through RSA Public/Private key exchange. To complete this configuration, please provide a Public RSA-SSH key.
Steps to create SSH keys can be found in [Aspera’s official documentation](https://download.asperasoft.com/download/docs/ascp/3.5.2/html/dita/creating_public_key.html)
Roku will provide host and username information during onboarding.
**Aspera Client**
[Aspera Client Download](https://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=ibm~Other%20software&product=ibm/Other%20software/IBM%20Aspera%20Desktop%20Client&release=All&platform=All&function=all)
#### Transfer Bandwidth
Roku recommends verifying or updating the global and user preferences of the Aspera Client to align with your preferred upload bandwidth. Please note Roku applies a global bandwidth cap of 300Mbps.
![asperaPreferences](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/asperaPreferences.jpg)
Depending on what client is being used, there are different settings that can affect transfer speeds.
  * If using the Desktop Client GUI, global settings can be set <https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/asdc/4.4.x?topic=gui-global-bandwidth-settings>
  * Transfer speeds can also be set on a per-Connection level (the "Speed" setting in step 7): <https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/asdc/4.4.x?topic=gui-adding-editing-connections>
  * If connecting via command line, there is a specific switch: `-l 100m` would set the transfer rate at 100Mbps
  * If connecting via Aspera Shares, target rates can be set both system-wide or per-user in the Shares web interface <https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aspera-shares/1.10?topic=options-configuring-transfer-settings> <https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aspera-shares/1.10?topic=accounts-configure-user-settings>

### File delivery
  * Video, closed captions, and artwork files must be _completely delivered prior to the delivery of metadata_
  * Production files MUST be delivered to the **`/prod`**folder. Automation is dependent on proper file delivery location. Failure to deliver files to the correct folder will result in processing delays or content not processing at all
  * Test files may be delivered to the **`/testing`**folder
  * It is preferred that content not be delivered to subfolders. If subfolders are necessary, follow the below guidelines:
  * Subfolders must **not** begin with an underscore
  * Do **not** separate files into subfolders by file type
  * All media files for a single title (episode, movie, or shortForm) must be delivered to the same directory
  * The ingest platform assumes media files referenced in the metadata are in the same directory as the metadata file. As such, metadata must be delivered to the same directory as the media files contained within the metadata
  * Delivery notifications can be sent to deliverynotifications@roku.com

#### File retention
The delivery location is a temporary location for our Partners to upload files for ingestion into Roku Channel content library. Automation will move files from the delivery location upon successful ingest to an archive location to be stored indefinitely. All files uploaded to the delivery location are expected to be ingested within a reasonable time frame not to exceed 30 days. Valid and complete metadata must be delivered shortly after files are delivered to ensure timely ingest. Files in the delivery location that have not ingested after 30 days are subject to deletion.
_Exceptions to the file retention policy may be made to files in the**`/testing`**folder_
#### File naming
Source video, closed captions, and artwork files delivered for ingest must adhere to the following guidelines:
  * File names must not exceed 125 characters in length
  * File names must match the reference to the file name in the metadata supplied for the title delivered
  * File names are case-sensitive
  * File names must end with a proper file extension. File extensions are expected to be lowercase
  * Whitespace and special characters `!@#$%^&*(){}|[]\;:’”?/><,` must not be included in any file name
  * The same image can be used for every episode of a series, but it is not ideal. If the same image is used for every episode, that image must be delivered multiple times and uniquely named for each episode. For example, “episode.jpg” should be delivered as “episode_01.jpg”, “episode_02.jpg”, etc.…

## MovieLabs content delivery
Order of delivery is important. The Roku MovieLabs service will require that the MMC XML file be delivered after all media files referenced within have completed delivery. Roku cannot process content without successful delivery of both the MMC and MEC XMLs. Please see examples below:
  * For each MMC, all files referenced in the MMC should be delivered prior to the delivery of the MMC XML to be considered a successful delivery
  * For each MEC, all files referenced in the MEC should be delivered prior to the delivery of the MEC XML to be considered a successful delivery
  * Movies, Series, Seasons, and Episodes require successful delivery of both MMC and MEC to ingest
  * Episodes cannot ingest without successful delivery and ingest of MMC and MEC of the Season to which the Episode belongs
  * Seasons cannot ingest without successful delivery and ingest of MMC and MEC of the Series to which the Season belongs
  * Episodes processed by Roku’s system before the Series and/or Season to which the Episode belongs will be held in an uningested state until the Series and/or Season has been successfully delivered
  * Seasons processed by Roku’s system before the Series to which the Season belongs and/or an Episode belonging to that Season will be held in an uningested state until the Series and/or an Episode has been successfully delivered
  * Series processed by Roku’s system before a Season and an Episode belonging to that Series will be held in an uningested state until a Season and Episode has been successfully delivered

### MovieLabs schema validation
Roku is using Apache [xmlbeans](https://xmlbeans.apache.org/download/index.html) for parsing & validating the MEC MMC XML files. You can use the command line tool provided in xmlbeans to validate.
  1. Download & extract xmlbeans to local
  2. From command line, cd to the xmlbeans bin directory
  3. Inside bin directory you will find the validate tool
  4. Also download the official MovieLab schema xsd files to local ( <https://movielabs.com/schema/manifest/v1.10/manifest-v1.10.xsd> <https://movielabs.com/schema/mdmec/v2.9/mdmec-v2.9.xsd> )
  5. Usage: validate schema.xsd instance.xml ( be sure to point schema.xsd to mdmec-v2.9.xsd for MEC, and manifest-v1.10.xsd for MMC )
  6. From the command line output you can tell if the given xml is valid or not

**Example usage**
```
./validate ~/dev/movielabsSpec/schema/mdmec-v2.9.xsd /path/to/file/directory/MEC_SAMPLE_123456789.xml

```

**Example response**
```
XMLBEANS_LIB=./../lib
ERROR StatusLogger Log4j2 could not find a logging implementation. Please add log4j-core to the classpath. Using SimpleLogger to log to the console...
/path/to/file/directory /MEC_SAMPLE_123456789.xml valid

```

## Metadata requirements
Roku utilizes a transform engine that can “normalize” different metadata formats to fit Roku’s ingestion needs. Exact element or field names are not as important as consistent delivery of agreed upon element or field names. The data within any field must conform to Roku Channel Ingest Specification regardless of element or field name. If you use an XML format for delivery of your content to other platforms, you may be able to repurpose this for delivery to Roku. You may provide a sample of this existing metadata format during onboarding for Roku to evaluate validity for ingest into Roku Channel. Regardless of the format delivered, all required elements/fields must be provided in the metadata deliverable.
### Minimum required metadata by content type
Film/Clip Requirements | TV Requirements
---|---
  * provider
  * content type
  * asset_id
  * title
  * release_date
  * runtime
  * genres
  * rating
  * rating system
  * short_synopsis
  * video file_name
  * captions file_name (if captions are required)
  * key art file_name

|
  * provider
  * content type
  * asset_id
  * episode title
  * episodeNumber
  * episode release_date
  * runtime
  * rating
  * rating system
  * episode short_synopsis
  * series_id
  * series title
  * series release_date

  * series short_synopsis
  * season_id
  * seasonNumber
  * video file_name
  * captions file_name (if captions are required)
  * episode thumbnail file_name
  * series key art file_name

### Content type definitions
Roku Channel supports 3 content types: tv, film, and clip. All content must be delivered as one of these 3 content types. Titles must be delivered to Roku Channel in the same content type the program was originally available in. The below definitions can help guide how to classify content that is intended for Roku Channel.
**TV**
Episodic content that is structured in a series --> season --> episode hierarchy should be delivered to the TV specification.
**Film**
Full length, long form, stand-alone titles should be delivered to the Film specification. Any program that is not intended to be nested in a series/season/episode hierarchy and exceeds roughly 15 minutes run time should be considered a film. This includes stand-alone TV Specials.
**Clip**
Short form, stand-alone titles that do not exceed roughly 15 minutes run time should be delivered to the Clip specification.
### ID requirements and expectations
Roku does not supply IDs for content. IDs are to be generated and supplied by the Partner for content that is delivered to Roku. Every clip and movie must be delivered with an asset_id. Every episode must be delivered with 3 IDs: an asset_id, a series_id, and a season_id. IDs need to be meaningful to your team as they are how we positively identify a title in our system. The asset ID in the ingest metadata should match the Title ID provided in the avail document. This will aid in tracking the content throughout Roku’s pipeline from Avails submission through publication on Roku Channel. Any updates to the title once it has been ingested into our system MUST be accompanied by the asset ID. Guidelines and definitions of IDs are below:
**ID** | Definitions
---|---
asset_id | Immutable, unique identifier for a clip, episode, or movie. Required for all content. 50 characters maximum. Alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores only – **SPACES OR SPECIAL CHARACTERS IN ANY ID WILL FAIL INGESTION**
series_id | Immutable, unique identifier for a series. Cannot be the same as the season or unique episode ID. Must be delivered with all episodes of a series and must be consistent for all episodes of a series. Required for TV content. 50 characters maximum. Alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores only – **SPACES OR SPECIAL CHARACTERS IN ANY ID WILL FAIL INGESTION**
season_id | Immutable, unique identifier for a season. Cannot be the same as the series or unique episode ID. Must be delivered with all episodes of a season of a series and must be consistent for all episodes within that season. Required for TV content. 50 characters maximum. Alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores only – **SPACES OR SPECIAL CHARACTERS IN ANY ID WILL FAIL INGESTION**
### Availability sheets/planners
Roku requests an initial launch list of titles/episodes/clips in current library that are available to Roku at the time of onboarding and a schedule when the content will be refreshed. For ongoing production, Roku requests that Avails be provided 60 days prior to licensing window start and the content be delivered at least 30 days before curation onto the channel. This will allow ample time for processing and QC of the content before it goes live on Roku Channel. Delivery capacity to be coordinated after signing

---|---
Roku Avail Spec | Check out the avail specifications page [here](https://go.roku.com/trc-avail-spec)
Roku Avail Template | Download Roku's avail template [here](https://go.roku.com/trc-avail-template)
### Availability windows
Roku has the ability for content to display on-device and for user playback at a specific starting time. By default, content will go into window at 12:00 am (midnight) and expire at 11:59:59 pm in the users’ time zone.
If content is to go live at a time other than midnight or expire at a time other than 11:59:59 pm, the license window start or end values in the inbound metadata must include the desired times.
There are two types of specific time designations – relative and absolute.
  * Relative Time – a Saturday night premiere of a movie goes into window at 9pm local time for all users. A user in the Eastern Time Zone watches at 9pm but a user in the Pacific Time Zone, at the exact same moment (6pm PT), cannot watch that content.
  * Absolute Time – a new episode of a series goes into window at 9pm Eastern and becomes immediately available across all time zones. A user in the Pacific Time Zone can watch the content at 6 pm local time.
While time settings are dictated by the content owner, Roku will need the metadata as follows:
  * If the content has a relative start time, that time must be indicated in the ingest metadata and formatted as “yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss” (2019-11-01T21:00:00)
  * If the content has an absolute start time, that time must be indicated in the ingest metadata. The time must be presented as UTC time and formatted as “yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ” (2019-11-02T01:00:00Z).
  * In this example, 9 pm Eastern Time on November 1 is 1 am UTC (<https://www.thetimezoneconverter.com>)
  * If the ingest metadata arrives without a time, Roku will assume a relative start time of midnight and a relative end time of 11:59:59 pm

### Special characters
Roku utilizes CDATA sections to allow special characters (e.g. !@#$%^&*(){}|[]\;:’”?/><, as well as foreign character sets) within certain node values of the ingest XML. Roku highly recommends wrapping data in CDATA sections to ensure proper ingest of content. The below nodes are the **only** nodes that support CDATA sections:
  * title
  * long_synopsis
  * short_synopsis
  * display_name

Certain characters in an XML will render the document unreadable by the Roku ingest platform unless handled (escaped) properly. The below characters must be provided in their Escaped Form for all node values that do not support CDATA sections:
Character Name | Character | Escaped Form
---|---|---
Ampersand | & | `&amp;`
Less-than | < | `&lt;`
Greater-than | > | `&gt;`
Quotes | " | `&quot;`
Apostrophe | ' | `&apos;`
Special characters should never be used in file names or file name references within the XML or Excel metadata. [See File Naming Guidelines](https://developer.roku.com/en-gb/trc-docs/video-on-demand/delivery/ingest-specifications.md#file-naming) for more on this.
### Supported metadata formats
XML format preferred. One complete XML shall be delivered for each movie, clip, or TV episode video file delivered. Metadata shall be delivered via Aspera to the same folder location as the video, captions, and artwork files.
**Supported metadata formats**
Format Name | Format Extension | Encoding | Package Version
---|---|---|---
XML (preferred) | .xml | UTF-8 | clip1.0
film5.0
tv1.0
Cablelabs ADI 1.1

** _Additional XML schemas supported on a case-by-case basis_**
Excel | .xlsx | See below for [Roku Excel Metadata Templates](https://developer.roku.com/en-gb/trc-docs/video-on-demand/delivery/ingest-specifications.md#roku-excel-metadata-guildelines) and [Excel Metadata Guidelines](https://developer.roku.com/en-gb/trc-docs/video-on-demand/delivery/ingest-specifications.md#roku-excel-metadata-guidelines-and-templates) |
### Metadata updates (MDU) and file replacements
Updates are automated and can be sent if there is a need to change metadata or asset files for any program that has previously been delivered to Roku Channel. All metadata and/or file replacement updates must include **Provider** , **Asset ID** , and **Content Type** of the program as it was originally delivered to Roku for the update to succeed. Version control will be handled by Roku's system, there is no need to provide versioning information in the metadata.
Roku currently supports updating the below metadata fields via automated MDU:
  * TMS ID
  * EIDR ID
  * Titles (primary and localized)
  * Short Descriptions (primary and localized)
  * Long Descriptions (primary and localized)
  * Release Date
  * Series Titles
  * Season Number
  * Episode Number
  * Language (and localized languages)
  * Availability Windows
  * License Types
  * Countries
  * Genres
  * Provider Tags
  * Content Ratings (system & rating)
  * Credits
  * Ad Breaks
  * Cue Points

**Metadata update (MDU)**
Metadata updates (MDUs) are automated and will be processed in the same manner as content that needs to be ingested into Roku Channel's content library. Please follow the procedure outlined below to update metadata only.
Metadata updates must be delivered in the same format as the ingest metadata
Metadata updates must include **the exact same asset ID** that was included when the content was originally ingested
_Please reach out tocontentoperations@roku.com if you need a complete listing of asset IDs as they exist in Roku Channel's system_
All file name references must be removed from a metadata only update. This includes:
  * source video file name
  * closed captions file name
  * subtitle file name
  * audio dub file name
  * key, background, and/or poster art file names

Some fields need to be updated in "groups". All required fields in a group must be provided for the update to process successfully. Below are the current groups:
  * Metadata group (all of the required fields must be present in order to update one of these)
  * Language (required)
  * Title (required)
  * Short description (required)
  * Long description (optional)
  * Availability group (all of the required fields must be present in order to update one of these)
  * License Type (required)
  * Country (required)
  * Start Date (required)
  * End Date (required)

Upload the metadata update to the "prod" folder in Aspera
_If you do not see the update reflected on Roku Channel within 24 hours, please reach out tocontentoperations@roku.com_
**File replacements and additions**
File replacements and additions are automated and will be processed in the same manner as content that needs to be ingested into Roku Channel's content library. A file replacement will replace a file that currently exists in Roku Channel's library. A file addition will add a new file to an existing record in Roku Channel's library. A file addition would be used to add localized subtitles or dubs to an existing record. Please follow the procedure outlined below to replace one or more files.
  1. File replacements and additions must be delivered in the same format as the ingest metadata
  2. File replacements and additions must include **the exact same asset ID** that was included when the content was originally ingested

  * _Please reach out tocontentoperations@roku.com if you need a complete listing of asset IDs as they exist in Roku Channel's system_

  3. Only the file name references of the files that are being replaced or added should be included in the metadata file. Any file that is not being replaced or added should not be delivered or referenced in the metadata file.
  4. If the source video file is being replaced and there is a change in the duration of the source, any related files (captions, subtitles, audio dubs) should also be replaced.
  5. File replacements require language values in order to update properly
  6. Upload the file replacement or addition metadata to the "prod" folder in Aspera

_As a best practice, please provide replacement files with a unique name both in the metadata and on the file itself. Simply adding a versionnumber (_v2, _v3, etc.) would suffice. For example:_ `movie_title_v2.mov`
**Content takedown**
If rights change from when the content was originally delivered to Roku and content needs to be removed from Roku Channel either immediately or scheduled, the availability end date can be changed by providing ametadata update as defined [below](https://developer.roku.com/en-gb/trc-docs/video-on-demand/delivery/ingest-specifications.md#metadata-updates-mdu-and-file-replacements). Explicit updates should be provided for all territories from which thecontent should be removed. Please be aware that end dates providedwithout time values specified will expire at 11:59:59pm on that date.

### Rating values by rating system and country
A valid film or TV rating from the rating authority (Rating Source) of the Territory the title will be available in shall be provided for each movie, episode, or shortForm video. If the title has not been rated by that Territory’s official rating authority, a rating of NR (Not Rated) may be provided, however please note that Roku strongly prefers an actual rating on all content. Titles with a rating of NR (Not Rated) will be subject to manual verification which can delay the selection process and publishing to Roku Channel. Discoverability on Roku Channel may also be impacted for titles with the NR (Not Rated) rating and placement within the Kids & Family experience will be prohibited. In lieu of the NR (Not Rated) rating, the title should be self rated using the USA_PR rating system. Guidelines pertaining to the USA_PR ratings can be found [here](http://tvguidelines.org/)
