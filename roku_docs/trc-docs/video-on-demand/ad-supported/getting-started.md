## Analytics & reporting
### Analytics dashboard
#### Overview
The Roku Channel partners have access to web-based performance analytics through Roku's Analytics Portal. This allows you to analyze the health, viewership trends, and metrics for specific titles.
#### Access to Roku's analytics portal
In order to access the partner dashboard, you will need a Roku account. To create a Roku account, click [here](https://my.roku.com/signup). If you have a Roku account, please send the e-mail address associated with the Roku account to trcpartnersupport@roku.com. We can give access to multiple Roku accounts, but it is preferred if you have one Roku account that your entire team can use to access the dashboard.
### Payout & revenue reporting

#### The Roku Channel partner payouts & revenue reports
Partners can select between three payout methods when enrolling in the Roku Partner Payouts Program:

  * Direct deposit / ACH
  * Wire transfer
  * **Please note that for partners outside the United States, only PayPal and wire transfers are available (direct deposit/ACH is not available).**
  * For all partners, wire transfer and ACH payments are made in USD only. If there are transactions received that are non-USD, they are converted to USD using the average foreign exchange rate for the month the payment is for.
