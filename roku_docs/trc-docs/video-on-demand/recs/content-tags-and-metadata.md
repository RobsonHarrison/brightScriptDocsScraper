# Best practices: content tags and metadata
_The following contains details for content tags and metadata related to media ingest. Please see[ingest specifications](https://developer.roku.com/trc-docs/video-on-demand/ingest-specifications.md#metadata-updates-mdu-and-file-replacements) for more._
We are often asked - how does the content appear on the Roku platform? The answer is almost always with metadata.
BETTER is MORE - MORE isn't necessarily BETTER
Due to Roku's propriety machine learning, we have enhanced personalization of all content offerings in the user interface. Different customers see different content categories based on their viewing behaviors and browse history. Utilizing standard Roku-provided tags will enable content to surface in more places across discovery products on the Roku platform and The Roku Channel. Without tags, limited visibility is likely - relegating content to fewer places.
Quality tagging will help boost the right content to the right people and in more places. Our studies have shown that irrelevant (aka 'bad') tags decrease content performance because of mismatches and machine learning. (For example, Schindler's List is tagged with 'comedy' and surfaces in a comedy row. Assuming comedy seekers will not want such a title, that movie will likely underperform because the algorithm will 'learn' it is not a high engagement comedy title and will be deprioritized).
## Roku recommendation:
Include **at least 2 relevant Roku Provided Tags** from the menu below on _every_ piece of content delivered to Roku (i.e., Episodes, Movies, Series..).
  * You are welcome to add additional relevant or brand specific tags (not on the list) along with the aforementioned Roku required tags. (e.g., LGBTQ, classic, biography)
  * For time-boxed, seasonal, or thematic collections, the Roku team will continue to create bespoke categories as requested in the monthly content refresh. (e.g., Halloween, Back to School, Mother's Day)
  * Roku reserves the right to make changes to metadata if/when content is miscategorized.
