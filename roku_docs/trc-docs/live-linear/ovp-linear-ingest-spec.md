# The Roku Channel live linear ingest specifications (OVP)
_Version 3.2_
## Overview
This specification describes the ingest specifications and EPG requirements required for your channel's content catalog to be included in [The Roku Channel](https://www.roku.com/whats-on/the-roku-channel). A catalog is the set of movies, series, TV specials, short-form videos or linear stream your channel provides, along with the artwork that represents it in the UI. A catalog feed (JSON) or Gracenote channel ID (aka ProgSrvID) includes the metadata that describes each asset so Roku can index it, categorize it, and present it to users. **Note: Gracenote channel id support is currently limited to linear channels with live sports only.**
The Roku Channel feed format follows the JSON-Schema Draft 4. All the properties in the schema are case sensitive. Before submitting a feed, make sure it is a valid JSON file. You can do that by using an IDE or free online tools, such as [JSON Schema Validator](https://www.jsonschemavalidator.net/) or [JSON Schema Lint](https://jsonschemalint.com/#!/version/draft-07/markup/json).
For guidelines about presenting your channel's EPG, see [EPG on The Roku Channel](https://developer.roku.com/trc-docs/live-linear/epg-on-trc.md).
### A note about deduplication of metadata
Roku augments metadata and artwork that appears in The Roku Channel on Roku devices, web browsers, mobile applications, and other off-platform players with data supplied from Gracenote’s database where available. The Gracenote data aids in a unified experience of a title across platforms as well as on the greater Roku ecosystem. Roku will attempt to match all content delivered by our Partners to a corresponding record in Gracenote’s database. _At this time all metadata and artwork that appears on The Roku Channel is sourced from Gracenote if that content is found in Gracenote’s database._
Our systems use a combination of methods to match a title its correct Gracenote record. Partners can aid in the matching to a Gracenote record by providing accurate metadata including:
  * Exact title of a series, movie, TV special, or short form video
  * Release dates that are accurate to the year the title was originally released on any platform
  * Accurate season and episode numbers according to the original release order
  * Accurate TMS (Gracenote) IDs or IMDB IDs by content type
    * Content classified as an episode with Gracenote must be delivered as an Episode to Roku
    * Content classified as a movie with Gracenote must be delivered as a movie to Roku
    * Content classified as a TV Special with Gracenote can be delivered as a movie to Roku

## Inclusion in The Roku Channel
In order for your content to be surfaced in The Roku Channel, you must adhere to this specification. If you already have a channel powered by Direct Publisher and you want its content to appear in The Roku Channel, you must ensure your feed meets the requirements described in this specification. Likewise, if you've built a channel using our developer program, then you must provide Roku with a separate feed adhering to this specification. The new feed must contain only assets that are available for display in The Roku Channel.
*_Note that participation in The Roku Channel is currently limited to select partners. Configuring your feed to meet this specification is a prerequisite to be reviewed for inclusion. To submit a feed for approval into The Roku Channel, contact your Roku representative._
All Linear Partners must utilize one of the **Linear** **Certified Partners** for their stream and EPG distribution: **Amagi, Wurl, Frequency, OTTera,** **Xumo, Akta, or Zype**. Exceptions will only be considered if the partner can agree to abiding by all rules and requirements as outlined in the linear certification agreement which can be provided if such an exemption is necessary.
### Error Reporting
Stream and EPG issue reports go directly to the LCPs. Stream issues and high priority EPG issues are reported as needed. Comprehensive EPG issue reports go out weekly to all LCPs.
