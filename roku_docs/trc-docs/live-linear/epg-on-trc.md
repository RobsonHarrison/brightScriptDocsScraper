# EPG on The Roku Channel
## Summary
The Roku Channel employs a Programming Guide for linear channels similar to that of a traditional TV Guide. This can be accessed by launching an EPG compatible live channel and using the left arrow on the remote, or by clicking the “Live TV” bookend tile in the live channel row.
**For the best user experience** , there are several required and highly recommended metadata guidelines which will be outlined below.
**_Note:_** _Some items below will require a linear partner to implement. Consult with your linear partner if you have any questions._

## Metadata by content type
**Tip** : Including Gracenote TMS ids or IMDB ids in your program metadata generally provides all the required metadata for any content type (see [A note about deduplication of metadata](https://developer.roku.com/en-gb/trc-docs/live-linear/epg-on-trc.md#a-note-about-deduplication-of-metadata)). TRC also supports channel level Gracenote TMS ids (aka ProgSrvIDs) but only for channels with live sports at this time. Ask your Roku rep for details.

### A note about deduplication of metadata:
Roku augments metadata and artwork that appears in The Roku Channel on Roku devices, web browsers, mobile applications, and other off-platform players with data supplied from Gracenote’s database where available. The Gracenote data aids in a unified experience of a title across platforms as well as on the greater Roku ecosystem. Roku will attempt to match all content delivered by our Partners to a corresponding record in Gracenote’s database. At this time all metadata and artwork that appears on The Roku Channel is sourced from Gracenote if that content is found in Gracenote’s database.
Our systems use a combination of methods to match a title its correct Gracenote record. Partners can aid in the matching to a Gracenote record by providing accurate metadata including:
  * Exact title of a series, movie, TV special, or short form video
  * Release dates that are accurate to the year the title was originally released on any platform
  * Accurate season and episode numbers according to the original release order
  * Accurate TMS (Gracenote) IDs or IMDB IDs for each associate content type
