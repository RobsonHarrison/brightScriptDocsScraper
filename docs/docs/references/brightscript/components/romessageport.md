# roMessagePort
A Message Port is the place messages ([events](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/core-concepts/event-loops.md)) are sent.
When using BrightScript, you would not call these functions directly. Instead, use the "Wait" BrightScript statement.
This object is created with no parameters:
`CreateObject("roMessagePort")`
