# Overview
Roku offers several free programs to apps for increasing their discoverability, including [Roku Search](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/discovery/search/implementing-search.md), and [Instant Signup](https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/discovery/instant-signup.md). These programs provide a high ROI as they typically require a simple integration without any economics. Participating in these free discovery programs enables apps to maximize the value of their content by increasing installations, engagement, and revenue via subscriptions, purchases/rentals, and ads.
The following table summarizes these content discovery programs, provides links to their implementation guides, and lists their requirements.
