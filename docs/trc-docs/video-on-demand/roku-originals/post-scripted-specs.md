The Roku Post Production Delivery Specifications outline the best practices for the Partner at this time. This document and the requirements are subject to change at Roku’s sole discretion.
## 2. Post kick-off
Post Producer resumes should be sent to Roku for prior approval. One week prior to Production start, please reach out to Roku Post Production to set up a kick-off call. In prep for this call, please review this full specification document so that we can address any follow up questions you may have.
### 2.1 Startup documents

#### 2.1.1 Episode numbering & post grid workflow
Post Grids accuracy must be confirmed weekly, either via revised grid or an email reflecting that no changes have been made. For distribution, Roku requires these grids to be both uploaded to The Hub and emailed to a distribution list that Roku Post Production will provide prior to Production.
Please note that the Post Grid template provides columns for multiple types of series, as noted below. If a specific column does not apply to your show, you can disregard it.
  * **Production Number:** 3-digit number that reflects season number and sequencing of shot material (101, 102, etc.)
    * One-off Specials should contain the prefix “SP” and begin with 100. (SP100, SP200, etc.)
  * **Air Order:** 1-digit number that reflects the order in which each episode will air

### 2.2 Notifications workflow
  * Once in production, any changes to the post schedule/calendar must be communicated to Roku Post Production immediately (within 24 hours)
  * **Quality Control Delivery and Final Delivery dates cannot shift without written approval by Roku Post Production**
  * At the below milestones please set a call with the Roku Post Production Manager at the email address provided on the contact sheet:
    * 1 week prior to Production
    * 1 week prior to the first scheduled rough cut release date
    * Within one week of production wrap

### 2.3 Misc.
  * Please be sure to include the full name of the show in the subject line of all email correspondence
  * Do not include the Roku name or logo on any documents (including contact sheets, call sheets, PR’s, casting notices etc.) without written permission from Roku Production
  * The Roku Contact sheet is for Studio use and should not be distributed widely

### 2.4 Roku marketing

### 3.1 Capture specifications
  * Unless otherwise approved by Roku production prior to the commencement of principal photography, you will be required to capture at a minimum resolution of UHD (3840x2160) and an Aspect Ratio of 16:9 to match final deliverables specs. Any changes to the required resolution or aspect ratio must be approved by Roku.
  * All material should be captured, transferred, and mastered in a progressive frame rate. Please do not apply any cross-conversions to content.
  * Please do not apply in-camera upscaling or de-squeezing to any camera masters. If your desire is to work with cameras that do not natively capture in 4k, please reach out to Roku Post Production to discuss workflow options.
  * Any material that is being shot or used for Visual Effects must match capture resolution. This resolution must remain consistent throughout the Visual Effects creation and final delivery process.

### 3.2 Camera tests
  * Prior to principal photography, please plan to shoot camera tests and post to [Frame.io](http://frame.io/) (Rough Cut 1 folder) for Roku review.
  * These do not need to contain talent, final lighting, or even audio. They will solely be utilized to confirm the efficacy of camera capture and dailies workflows.
  * Camera test material can be a quick compilation of various shots and angles; it is not necessary to cut a full scene together.
  * Roku Post Production will provide a distribution list for all camera test material. If you have not received it, please reach out to your Roku Post Manager.

### 3.3 Dailies
#### 3.3.1 Dailies distribution
Allow for dailies and/or weekly selects. Dailies are requested for visibility and early Marketing preparation. Roku Post will provide a user list for Dailies prior to Production.
Roku’s approved platform for dailies, rough cut release, and final archive is [Frame.io](http://frame.io/). All content being sent for review by the Roku team will need to be shared via this platform. [Frame.io](http://frame.io/)’s platform is compatible with most commonly used codecs, so if you are working with a partner who utilizes a different review platform, this may not require an extra render (pending specifications for each).
The Roku Post team will initiate onboarding prior to the first day of production. Each series will only be granted one ‘Team Manager’, who will have the ability to add users and download content (with Roku’s approval).
#### 3.3.2 Dailies formatting
Dailies should be posted and organized according to their corresponding shoot day. For Productions who are cross-boarding, further organization per episode within the master folder is permitted but not required.
Each take should be uploaded as one clip within the overall day’s dailies folder. Please ensure that the camera roll source and scene/take information is available for every clip uploaded, either via burn-in windows or file naming. Source camera timecode should be burned into picture.
Once dailies have been uploaded to [Frame.io](http://frame.io/), please send a notification email to those reviewing Dailies, per the Distribution List provided by your Roku Originals Post Manager. Please include the following in each email:
  * In the subject line include the show title, episode # and dailies day
  * In the body of the email the include the link from the address bar to the [Frame.io](http://frame.io/) dailies project.

#### 3.3.3 Dailies memo
A Dailies Memo should be submitted to the Roku Production and Post Production teams for approval prior to the commencement of principal photography. This document should include the proposed dailies workflow process, from camera capture through dailies distribution.
## 4. Security
Security is of the utmost importance to Roku. As such, access to all of the exciting content we are creating together must be limited. Please review Roku’s security requirements noted below and reach out to Roku Post Production with any questions.
### 4.1 Review platform
Roku’s approved platform for content sharing and final archive is [Frame.io](http://frame.io/). Roku and [Frame.io](http://frame.io/) have developed a content review workflow that both ensures security and limits access to all pre-launched content. In this workflow, anyone viewing Roku content will be required to set up a user account within [Frame.io](http://frame.io/) so that their activity can be tracked. **No material should be shared on any other platform without written approval from Roku.**
### 4.2 Download access
**It is not permitted for anyone to have direct, clean download access to any Roku content without written approval from Roku.**
For team members who require reference QuickTimes in order to complete their work efficiently (i.e., Composers, Music Editors, Visual Effects Supervisors), please follow the steps below:
  * Submit a written request with the recipient’s name, email, and use case. Upon Roku approval:
    * Each file must be watermarked with the recipient’s full name and located in the center of picture.
    * Recipients should never be given access to an entire folder’s worth of content; Review links that contain solely the required assets should be sent to the Roku approved recipients. This link must be manually expired as soon as the file has been successfully downloaded.
    * Files should always be housed on a vendor’s secure Storage Area Network. Files are never permitted to be stored on anyone’s personal device.
    * It is the responsibility of each show's Post team to request vendor deletion of these files at show wrap.

### 4.3 Content review
[Frame.io](http://frame.io/)’s Roku Partner Playbook is shared with the Post team at the start of each project. This workflow must be followed for both cuts released to Roku and also cuts released prior (Editor, Director, Producers, etc.). If you have not received this document, please reach out to Roku Post Production.
All guidelines below must be followed when sharing review links:

  * It is not permitted for any rough cut viewing links to be download-enabled.
  * All viewing links must include an expiration date that confines access to seven days or less.
  * **All cuts uploaded for review must be watermarked.**

### 4.4 Non-standard requests
It is not permitted to send content to anyone who is not a [Frame.io](http://frame.io/) user without written approval from Roku.
## 5. Rough cuts and viewables
### 5.1 Post weekly sync
Once you begin the rough-cut process, your Roku Post Manager will reach out to schedule a weekly call. The call will be an informal sync to determine how the rough cuts are progressing and help address any questions you may have. If you have made any changes to the Post Grid over the week prior, please send a revised version prior to this call.
### 5.2 Rough cut formatting
#### 5.2.1 General requirements
Below are the basic parameters to keep in mind as you begin the rough cut process:

    * Short Form - Each episode should be no longer than 15 minutes in total run time. Each episode’s content and length should be approved by the Roku Content team prior to lock.
    * Half Hour - Each episode's run time should be between 22-24 minutes.
    * For Hour Long shows - Each episode’s run time should be between 44-48 minutes.
    * **For All Locked Cuts** - QT's must include a slug for the end credits so that the exact timing is locked to match the final master.
  * Each episode of content should commence with a “cold open” prior to any logos, credits or title sequence in order to immediately engage the viewer.
  * There may be discussions around pre-roll, mid-roll, or post-roll advertising cue points. Regardless, please deliver each episode as a seamless master.

#### 5.2.2 Music
Roku distributes content worldwide. Music should be cleared in perpetuity (or for licensed projects, the full length of the license), and allow for in-context promotional use, unless approved in writing by Roku Production Legal. Please source music that is covered by the following PROs: BMI, ASCAP, SESAC, and GMR.
#### 5.2.3 Ad breaks
All Roku Originals series are required to include ad breaks. Please refer to the parameters below based off your episode run times.

  * Formatting across all run times:
    * **The ad breaks should not appear until at least five minutes of content have elapsed.**

    * The final ad break must appear before the last three minutes of an episode, which will remain ad-free.
    * All ad breaks should be spaced anywhere from six to ten minutes apart, dependent on the creative.

**All best efforts should be made to abide by the parameters noted above. Creatively, if a rough cut cannot meet these requirements, you will need to flag the variations within the rough cut release email to Roku.**
If an episode will not meet the maximum run time, and this has been previously approved by Roku’s Content team, please reach out to Roku Post Production to discuss ad break implications.
The exact timecode of the ad break, in (HH:MM:SS:FF) format, will be required in both the Segment Rundown and Metadata deliverables. Both templates were provided in the Post Kickoff Deliverables Packet. Please reach out to Roku Post if you did not receive one.
#### 5.2.4 Rating guidelines
Roku Originals content must fall within a TV-14 or TV-PG rating. Some general ratings guidance has been provided below for you to keep in mind as the creative story progresses in editorial.

### 5.3 Rough cut review
#### 5.3.1 Review platform
Roku’s approved platform for dailies, rough cut release, and final archive is [Frame.io](http://frame.io/). All content being sent for review by the Roku team will need to be shared via this platform. If you are working with a partner who utilizes a different internal platform, there will not be a need to render out separate files just for use with [Frame.io](http://frame.io/); [Frame.io](http://frame.io/)’s platform is compatible with most commonly used codecs, which allows the same file to be uploaded to both platforms.
Each series will only be granted one ‘Team Manager’, who will have the ability to add users and download content within their own workspace (with Roku’s approval). Roku Post will handle user management for their space, which contains ‘Shared’ projects that are access by both partner and Roku teams . For any questions about this process, please reach out to your Post Manager.
#### 5.3.2 Review process & turnaround timing
For each episode, Roku will provide notes within 48 business hours after receipt, whether the Production Company is based in the United States or outside the United States. Cuts received by Roku after 6:00 pm PST will be deemed received the following business day. When sending cuts earlier than the scheduled release date, please note that the original notes return timing will need to be honored unless otherwise approved by Roku Creative.
Locked cuts are approved if no notes have been sent after 48 hours.
Rounds of Review:
  * RC → FC → LC

Please follow turnaround timing parameters below when addressing notes from the Roku Content Team:
  * Eps. 1-3 cuts must be turnaround within five business days of receiving notes from Roku
  * Eps. 4+ cuts must all be turned around within three business days of receiving notes from Roku

Up to two half-hour episodes (or one hour-long episode) can be sent within a 48-hour period. No more than three 10-minute episodes, per show, should be sent within a 48-hour period.
For series with one or more story arcs, episodes should be sent for review in the order they will ultimately air on the Roku platform. For anthology series, or series consisting of stand-alone/self-contained episodes, rough cuts may be sent out of air order, if necessary.
Check with your Content Executive regarding single vs. batch delivery of cuts.
For any variations to the schedule above, please check with your Post Production or Content executive for review and approval prior to the release of the first rough cut.

## 8. Final delivery
The specifications below detail all deliverables required for each Roku production. A production will not be considered wrapped until all assets below are delivered and approved by the Roku Post Production team. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to Roku Post Production.
The Delivery Phase begins as soon as your episodes are ready for Quality Control, after visual effects, color, and mix are complete. The following timeline is required to ensure that all assets are received on time for Post, Marketing, and Operations:
  * Due 1 Week Before First Episode Delivered to Quality Control Vendor
    * Let Roku Post know which vendor you’re proceeding with
    * Metadata Ingest Document due to the Hub [See 8.7.1]
  * Due With Delivery to Quality Control Vendor
    * Texted Masters
    * Textless Masters (if applicable)
    * Text Spotting List

### 8.1 Onboarding
Roku uses an External Deliverables Hub (“Hub”) to receive specific production documents. This Hub will also provide information necessary for the naming of each document and file deliverable. If you have not heard from the Roku Post Production team prior to delivery, please reach out to be set up with access to the Hub.
### 8.2 Quality control (QC)
Each Production is responsible for covering the cost of and delivering 100% QC approved content. All masters noted below will be required to be submitted to QC **using one of Roku’s approved QC vendors:**
  * Texted Master
  * Textless Master

All required versions for each episode should be delivered to the Quality Control facility on the same day. This will ensure the Quality Control operator is able to verify that there is no variation between the texted/textless timings.
Please be sure to build time into your delivery schedule to account for the Roku Quality Control process. Roku advises that you set aside three weeks for each episode to complete the Quality Control of all masters. Delivery will not be considered ‘Final’ unless all masters have received a passing report from one of Roku’s approved vendors. A list of these vendors will be provided in the Post Kickoff Packet.
If an episode has passed Quality Control but a revision is necessary (incorrect titles, production card modification, etc.) you **must** reach out to Roku Post before any redelivery is made. Please send an email with a detailed and time coded breakdown of what fixes are being requested so that Roku can review and determine the impact it will have on each team and the show premiere itself.
#### 8.2.1 Text spotting list (TSL)
You will be required to deliver a Text Spotting List file for each episode when it is submitted for Quality Control. This list will help Quality Control vendors verify that creatively intended text is included in the final file. A Roku Text Spotting list template was provided in your Post Kickoff zip file. This single file should be updated as episodes are sent to Quality Control so that all information for the series is included in the same master spreadsheet.
The Text Spotting List should contain any and all text that is burned into picture, and the corresponding timecodes for each. If an episode has no burned-in text, you will still be required to deliver this file, but will specify the lack of text by checking the box at the top of the template.
### 8.3 Filename Specifications

### 8.4 Video deliverables
All video should be delivered at specification unless agreed to with the Roku production team ahead of production.
If your image capture settings are not at the same data rate or higher of the export settings mentioned in 8.4.3, please reach out to Roku Post or let your Post Manager know. In order to prevent up-sampling, your final export should match the data rate that was captured (for example, if the camera captured ProRes 422, then final export should be ProRes 422 or equivalent instead of 4444 XQ).
**_Roku Best Practices_**
It is important to keep master sequences (VAM/CTM) and final deliverables in alignment with dailies capture specifications (i.e. free of any up-scaling, cross-conversions, or up-conversions).
#### 8.4.1 Video formatting
All files should be formatted to start at 00:00:00:00.
Files should begin with the cold open and end on the last frame of the Roku Originals logo end card.
All video files MUST NOT contain any of the following: bars and tone, bumpers, segment recaps or previews, Vertical Interval time code time code, advertisements, slates, rating cards, FBI warning cards, placards, overlay branding, promotional bugs, informational bugs, watermarks, or website link callouts.
If promotional bugs or watermarks are required by a 3rd party, Roku Content Legal should be notified.
#### 8.4.2 Audio formatting
For the Final Texted Masters, all audio should be contained within the delivered mezzanine file. See the audio settings listed in 8.4.3 for specifications based on delivery codec.
**The audio channel mapping and tagging of metadata must be verified via a program like QuickTime 7, QuickTime Pro, Telestream Switch or Adobe Media Encoder for all texted and textless masters.**
  * If the audio is not labeled with the correct metadata (for instance if all channels are labeled as “C” or “Mono”) this will prevent ingest on Roku’s end and will need to be corrected and re-delivered.
  * Incorrectly labeled audio can be manually adjusted in QuickTime Pro without a re-export.

Mixing Specifications:
  * Target - 24 LKFS +/- 2 (any average between -22 & -26). Based on ITU-R 1170-3 measurement.
  * Audio should not peak above -2 dBfs (True Peak)

Channel Mapping & Metadata Tagging | See 8.4.2 -Verify correct audio channel mapping and metadata tagging.
#### 8.4.4 Textless delivery
If your content includes burned-in on screen text, you will be required to deliver a separate Textless Reel or Full Episode. This reel should include clean, text-free versions of any shots that contain burned-in subtitles or graphic text elements. If the show contains a comprehensive graphics package, please strip all graphics and supply the graphics package or elements in Archival. Video and Audio specs should mirror the Texted Masters noted above.
Audio mapping label verification as noted in 8.4.2 must be verified in textless master.
Additionally, if foreign language subtitles cover 30% or more of a given episode, you will be required to deliver a fully textless version of that episode. All episodes should be delivered with the same formatting; if one episode requires a textless master, versus a reel, then all remaining episodes should also be delivered as textless masters.
Examples of what to remove for the Textless Masters:
**Forced Narratives** | **Credits** | **Text-Based Graphics**

_Roku Best Practices_
  * Background elements with text, such as street signs, do not need to be included in the Textless Reel.
  * ‘Forced Narratives’ refers to on-screen text that is used in one of two ways: to translate foreign dialogue into English or to clarify dialogue that may be inaudible.
