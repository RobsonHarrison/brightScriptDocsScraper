# Acquired content - scripted media delivery specifications
_Version 3.0_ - _August 2025_
## 1. General overview
The Roku Channel is committed to providing the highest quality content and values its Partners for helping to achieve this goal. The Roku Originals Post Production Delivery Specifications outline the best practices for the Partner at this time. This document and the requirements are subject to change at Roku’s sole discretion.
The specifications below encompass deliverables for Roku Originals Post Production, as they relate to previously completed, acquired series. It is not comprehensive of all deliverables that may be required as part of your agreement. Please continue to utilize the [The Roku Channel Ingest Specifications](https://developer.roku.com/trc-docs/video-on-demand/ingest-specifications.md) document for all other areas noted below:
  * Ad Policy
  * Kids Directed Content Policy
  * External Branding and Calls to Action
  * Artwork and Marketing Deliverables
  * File Delivery Setup

If the Roku Originals Content Development teams will be a part of the creative, editorial process, please reach out to Roku Post Production to obtain the correct specifications.
## 2. Deliverables
The specifications below detail all deliverables required for each Roku production. A production will not be considered wrapped until all assets below are delivered and confirmed by the Roku Post Production team. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to Roku Post Production.
### 2.1 Roku originals logo
All acquired content that will be branded as a Roku Original series will be required to add the Roku Originals Logo to their end credits. The Roku Originals Logo should be placed last in the end credits. **Please reach out directly to Roku Post for access to the most current Roku Original Logo at:dlropost@roku.com**
### 2.2 Quality control (QC)
Each Production is responsible for covering the cost of and delivering 100% Quality Control approved content.
All masters noted below will be required to be submitted to Quality Control:
  * Texted Master – Inclusive of Roku Originals End Logo addition
  * Textless Master – Inclusive of Roku Originals End Logo addition

All required versions for each episode should be delivered to the Quality Control facility on the same day. This will ensure the Quality Control operator is able to verify that there is no variation between the texted/textless timings.
Please be sure to build time into your delivery schedule to account for the Roku Quality Control process. Roku advises that you set aside three weeks for each episode to complete the Quality Control of all horizontal masters. Delivery will not be considered ‘Final’ unless all masters have received a passing report from one of Roku’s approved vendors. A list of these vendors will be provided in the Post Kickoff Packet.
If an episode has passed Quality Control but a revision is necessary (incorrect titles, production card modification, etc.) you **must** reach out to Roku Post before any redelivery is made. Please send an email with a detailed and time coded breakdown of what fixes are being requested so that Roku can review and determine the impact it will have on each team and the show premiere itself.
#### 2.2.1 Text spotting list (TSL)
You will be required to deliver a Text Spotting List file for each episode when it is submitted for Quality Control. This list will help Quality Control vendors verify that creatively intended text is included in the final file. A Roku Text Spotting List template was provided in your Post Kickoff zip file. This single file should be updated as episodes are sent to Quality Control so that all information for the series is included in the same master spreadsheet.
The Text Spotting List should contain any and all text that is burned into picture, and the corresponding timecodes for each. If an episode has no burned-in text, you will still be required to deliver this file, but will specify the lack of text by checking the box at the top of the template.
### 2.3 Filename specifications

### 2.4 Video deliverables
All video should be delivered at specification unless agreed to with the Roku production team ahead of production.
If your image capture settings are not at the same data rate or higher of the export settings mentioned in 2.4.3, please reach out to Roku Post or let your Post Manager know. In order to prevent up-sampling, your final export should match the data rate that was captured (for example, if the camera captured ProRes 422, then final export should be ProRes 422 or equivalent instead of 4444 XQ).
_Roku Best Practices_
If your capture workflow is different than specified above, please contact Roku Post Production before final mastering begins. It is important to keep master sequences (VAM/CTM) and final deliverables in alignment with dailies capture specifications (i.e. free of any up-scaling, cross-conversions, or up-conversions).
#### 2.4.1 Video formatting
All files should be formatted to start at 00:00:00:00.
Files should begin with program and end on the last frame of the Roku Originals Logo end card.
All video files **MUST NOT** contain any of the following: bars and tone, bumpers, segment recaps or previews, Vertical Interval time code, advertisements, slates, rating cards, FBI warning cards, placards, overlay branding, promotional bugs, informational bugs, watermarks, or website link callouts.
If promotional bugs or watermarks are required by a 3rd party, Roku Content Legal should be notified.
#### 2.4.2 Audio formatting
For the Final Texted Masters, all audio should be contained within the delivered mezzanine file. See the audio settings listed in 2.4.3 for specifications based on delivery codec.
Mixing Specifications:
**The audio channel mapping and tagging of metadata must be verified via a program like QuickTime 7, QuickTime Pro, Telestream Switch or Adobe Media Encoder for all texted and textless masters.**
  * If the audio is not labeled with the correct metadata (for instance if all channels are labeled as “C” or “Mono”) this will prevent ingest on Roku’s end and will need to be corrected and re-delivered.
  * Incorrectly labeled audio can be manually adjusted in QuickTime Pro without a re-export.

Mixing Specifications:
  * Target - 24 LKFS +/- 2 (any average between -22 & -26). Based on ITU-R 1170-3 measurement.
  * Audio should not peak above -2 dBfs (True Peak)

#### 2.4.4 Textless delivery
Textless Masters are a Roku Original-specific deliverable. They protect for any potential distribution outside of the United States.
If your content includes burned-in on screen text, you will be required to deliver a separate Textless Reel or Full Episode. This reel should include clean, text-free versions of any shots that contain burned-in subtitles or graphic text elements. If the show contains a comprehensive graphics package, please strip all graphics and supply the graphics package or elements in Archival. Video and Audio specs should mirror the Texted Masters noted above.
Audio mapping label verification as noted in 2.4.2 must be verified in textless master.
Additionally, if foreign language subtitles cover 30% or more of a given episode, you will be required to deliver a fully textless version of that episode. All episodes should be delivered with the same formatting; if one episode requires a textless master, versus a reel, then all remaining episodes should also be delivered as textless masters.
#### 2.4.5 Final proxy files (clean & visible timecode)

### 2.5 Audio delivery
Audio stems are a Roku Original-specific deliverable. Full audio stem delivery may not be required for each series.
