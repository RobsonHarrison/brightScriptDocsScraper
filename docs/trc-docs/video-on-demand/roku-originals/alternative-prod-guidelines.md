  * Foreign General Liability (if applicable)
  * Cast Insurance
    * The necessary cast members should be declared so they are eligible for cast insurance.
    * Please discuss with Roku Production Legal whether your talent needs to be declared separately for Cast Insurance Coverage; and additionally, whether accident-only or full coverage would be preferable.

    * There may be special risks associated with your project. This includes but is not limited to stunts, firearms, minors, pyrotechnics, precision driving, aircraft, drones, watercraft, railroads, foreign activities, animals, or any unusual or hazardous exposures and/or conditions involving either cast or crew.

### 6.3 Music
Roku distributes content worldwide. Music should be cleared in perpetuity (or for licensed projects, the full length of the license), and allow for in-contect promotional use, unless approved in writing by Roku Production Legal. Please source music that is covered by the following PROs: BMI, ASCAP, SESAC, and GMR.
Please reach out to your Roku Production Executive with specific questions or if there are cost implications above and beyond what is in the budget to license per the aforementioned guidelines.
### 6.4 Content takedown request
We understand there may be occasions when content needs to be removed from The Roku Channel (e.g., 3rd party rights issues, legal orders, Public Relations concerns). In the event content needs to be removed, please email Roku Production and Roku Production Legal.
We ask that you provide the following information in the body of your email request:
  * The episode # and title
  * The specific reason for the removal request (e.g., "wrong photo included in opening shot," "music was not cleared properly")
  * A point of contact along with email and phone number to call for any follow up questions
  * An ETA for delivery of a replacement episode
  * Ideally when requesting that content be removed from the Roku eco-system, you will be able to provide a replacement episode ASAP. If this is not possible (or deemed not necessary based on the content), Roku will address on a case-by-case basis

## 7. Post
Please review the Roku Alternative Media Delivery Specifications for a comprehensive breakdown of all post workflows and media deliverables. The document can be found via the “Welcome to Roku Production” site or the Hub in the Post – Alternative Folder.
Roku’s approved platform for dailies, rough cut release, and final archive is [Frame.io](http://frame.io/), which Roku provides free of charge to our production partners. All content sent to Roku for review needs to be shared via [Frame.io](http://frame.io/).
### 7.1 Music cue sheets
Music cue sheets are required for all projects. Please use the cue sheet template found on the ASCAP website linked [here](https://www.ascap.com/help/royalties-and-payment/cue-sheets) or similar cue sheet template when submitting to Roku. The ASCAP template is also available via the Hub under the Production Legal – Alternative folder.
Upload completed cue sheets to the Hub. If you have any specific questions about Roku requirements for Music Cue Sheets, please contact Sydnee Grossberg at sgrossberg@roku.com.
## 8. Paper deliverables
Roku uses a deliverables Hub (“Hub”) to receive specific production documents. The Hub is project specific and will serve as the portal for key paper deliverables. Please remember the materials and folders are confidential and may not be shared beyond authorized parties. With a few exceptions, the Hub is used in lieu of emailing various Roku teams relevant documentation.
Prior to pre-production you will receive an email with instructions for accessing the Hub.
Due to the **confidential** nature of the requested paper deliverables, access to the Hub will be limited to four (4) key project personnel. Only those who are responsible for uploading the deliverables as noted in [section 8.1](https://developer.roku.com/en-gb/trc-docs/video-on-demand/roku-originals/alternative-prod-guidelines.md#81-required-paper-deliverables), should have access.
### 8.1 Required paper deliverables
Productions should be uploading documents to the Hub on an ongoing basis throughout all phases of production, starting with pre-production and concluding with uploading final documents during wrap.
Below you’ll find a list of **paper** deliverables for Production, Post and Production Legal. Please be aware, this list is subject to amendment (within reason) at any time.
