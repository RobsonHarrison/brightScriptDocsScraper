### **8.2 Deliverables checklist**
On the Hub you will find a deliverables checklist, the checklist is considered part of your paper deliverables.
Please only mark items as complete once the final versions have been uploaded. If an item is not applicable (“N/A”), please upload a word document that says N/A and a short explanation as to why it is not applicable to your production. You may then mark that item complete on the checklist.
Email Roku Production once all items have been delivered and the checklist is filled out completely. Once final delivery is received and approved, access to the Hub will be removed.
For questions or concerns please reach out to Roku Production at altprod@roku.com.
### **8.3 Naming conventions**
All Roku projects have a unique Project Title ID (PTID). You must follow specific naming conventions for the files to be considered acceptable. Examples of how each file(s) should be named can be found on the Hub, in the Production - Branded folder.
If items are not delivered correctly, they will not be accepted. Please do not add or remove folders. If you have questions or can't find specific folders, please reach out to Roku Production.
