**When will my title(s) go live?**
Content delivery is recommended 60 days prior to start date. All titles undergo a multi-factor QC review before publishing to ensure they meet customer quality content expectations. Any errors found during QC review can lengthen publishing timelines significantly. QC can take a minimum of 30 days and our operations team will provide feedback on content that has not passed our QC review.
Once the QC review is complete, if there are no errors in your submission, your title will typically go live within 2-4 business days.
**How do I find my titles on The Roku Channel?**
You can find your content in three ways: Universal Search, The Roku Channel Search, and/or curated in The Roku Channel UI. Note The Roku Channel's UI is curated via a recommendations system. Thus, each user's UI will be different based on the content watched.
**I would like to send additional movies and/or TV series for The Roku Channel. What is the process?**
Please fill out the avails template (series and features/movies on separate templates) and send to trc-avod-avails@roku.com. Avails template can be downloaded [here](https://devtools.web.roku.com/samples/TheRokuChannel_AvailsTemplate_v1_2.xlsx) and the avails specifications can be found [here](https://developer.roku.com/docs/trc/video-on-demand/title-avail-specifications.md). Our programming team will review the submissions and follow up on the next steps. Please note selections can take up to 4 weeks.
**I have a title(s) that need to be taken down from The Roku Channel.**
If rights change from when the content was originally delivered to Roku and content needs to be removed from The Roku Channel either immediately or scheduled, the availability end date can be changed by providing a metadata update as defined in [The Roku Channel Ingest Specification](https://developer.roku.com/trc-docs/video-on-demand/ingest-specifications.md#metadata-updates-mdu-and-file-replacements). Explicit updates should be provided for all territories from which the content should be removed. Please be aware that end dates provided without time values specified will expire at 11:59:59pm on that date.
Takedown notices for Feed partners should be sent via email to avod-editorial@roku.com & contentoperations@roku.com and include **Name of Title** & **End Date**. Once takedown notice is confirmed from our Editorial and Operations team, partner must remove the title from the feed.
### Roku preferred aggregators
**I have delivered my content through one of Roku's Preferred Aggregators. When will my content go live?**
Although we cannot speak to the Preferred Aggregator's timelines, once the Preferred Aggregator has delivered the titles, all titles undergo a multi-factor QC review before publishing to ensure they meet customer quality content expectations. Any errors found during QC review can lengthen publishing timelines significantly. QC can take a minimum of 30 days and our operations team will provide feedback on content that has not passed our QC review.
**I would like to send additional movies and/or TV series for The Roku Channel. What is the process?**
Please send all additional avails through your Preferred Aggregator.
### Analytics & reporting
**I have a channel app(s) on Roku and distribute my content on The Roku Channel. Will I receive payment for both?**
If you have a channel app(s) on Roku, payments are sent out monthly whereas payments for The Roku Channel are sent out quarterly (Revenue Reports are sent via email 60 days' post quarter closing). Thus, you will only receive a lump sum payment for your channel app and content on The Roku Channel four times a year. Revenue reports sent via e-mail are only for content in The Roku Channel and do not apply to your channel app(s).
**Why wasn’t I paid?**
Roku does not verify bank account information. Our system only verifies the routing number and tax documents. If any of the bank account information you initially entered is incorrect, it will not be possible to pay you. In this case, you will receive a notification that the payment to you failed, and you will be asked to update your payment information in the Developer Dashboard.
### Fulfillment Statuses
**What does “Unfulfilled” mean?**
A title is marked _Unfulfilled_ when the ordered rights and the content asset haven’t been matched yet. To advance, the rights must be linked to the asset using matching IDs. Make sure the rights ID and asset ID are the same.
**What does “Ordered” mean?**
_Ordered_ means the rights have been received, but the content itself hasn’t been delivered yet.
**What does “Not Availed” mean?**
_Not Availed_ means the content has been delivered, but the rights couldn’t be matched. This usually occurs if the Asset ID in the ingest package doesn’t align with the Partner Title ID in the rights data.
