We ask that you provide the following information in the body of your email request:
  * The episode # and title
  * The specific reason for the removal request (e.g., "wrong photo included in opening shot," "music was not cleared properly”)
  * A point of contact along with email and phone number to call for any follow up questions
  * An ETA for delivery of a replacement episode
    * Ideally when requesting that content be removed from the Roku eco-system, you will be able to provide a replacement episode ASAP. If this is not possible (or deemed not necessary based on the content), Roku will address on a case-by-case basis

## 7. Post
Please review the Roku Scripted Media Delivery Specifications for a comprehensive breakdown of all post workflows and media deliverables. The document can be found via the “Welcome to Roku Production” site or the Hub in the Post – Scripted folder.
Roku’s approved platform for dailies, rough cut release, and final archive is [Frame.io](http://frame.io/), which Roku provides free of charge to our production partners. All content sent to Roku for review needs to be shared via [Frame.io](http://frame.io/).
### 7.1 Music cue sheets
Music Cue Sheets are required for all projects. Please use the cue sheet template found on the ASCAP website linked [here](https://www.ascap.com/help/royalties-and-payment/cue-sheets) or similar cue sheet template when submitting to Roku. The ASCAP template is also available via the Hub in the Production Legal – Scripted folder.
Upload completed cue sheets to the Hub. If you have specific questions about Roku requirements for Music Cue Sheets, please contact Sydnee Grossberg at sgrossberg@roku.com.
## 8. Paper deliverables
Roku uses a Deliverables Hub (“Hub”) to receive and retain specific production documents. The Hub is project specific and will serve as the portal for key paper deliverables. Please remember the materials and folders are confidential and may not be shared beyond authorized parties. With a few exceptions, the Hub is used in lieu of emailing various Roku teams’ relevant documentation.
Prior to pre-production you will receive an email with instructions for accessing the Hub.
Due to the **confidential** nature of the required paper deliverables, access to the Hub will be limited to four (4) key project personnel. Only those who are responsible for uploading deliverables noted in [Section 8.1](https://developer.roku.com/fr-fr/trc-docs/video-on-demand/roku-originals/scripted-prod-guidelines.md#81-required-paper-deliverables), should have access.
### 8.1 Required paper deliverables
Productions should upload documents to the Hub on an ongoing basis throughout all phases of production, starting with pre-production and concluding with uploading final documents during wrap.
Below you’ll find a list of **paper** deliverables for Production, Post, and Production Legal. Please be aware, this list is subject to amendment (within reason) at any time. Make sure to follow the specific instructions for each document and upload accordingly. Please note other departments may have additional required deliverables.

### 8.2 Deliverables checklist
On the Hub you will find a Deliverables Checklist. The checklist is considered part of your paper deliverables. Only mark items as complete once the final versions are uploaded. If an item is not applicable (“N/A”), please upload a word document that says N/A and a short explanation as to why it is not applicable to your production. You may then mark that item complete on the checklist.
Email Roku Production once all items are delivered and the checklist is filled out completely. Once final delivery is received and approved, access to the Hub will be removed.
For questions or concerns reach out to Roku Production at scrprod@roku.com.
### 8.3 Naming conventions
All Roku projects have a unique Project Title ID (PTID). You must follow specific naming conventions for the files to be considered acceptable. Examples of how each file should be named can be found on the Hub in the Production – Scripted folder.
If items are not delivered correctly, they will not be accepted. Please do not add or remove folders. If you have questions or can't find specific folders, please reach out to Roku Production.
